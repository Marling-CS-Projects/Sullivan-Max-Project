# 3.2 Usability Testing

## Criteria To Assess

| Test               | Test Details                                                                                                                             |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1 - Effective      | Is the aim of each level easy? Is the aim of the game clear?                                                                             |
| 2 - Efficient      | Is the menu easy to navigate?                                                                                                            |
| 3 - Engaging       | Is it challenging enough to retain players? Is it easy enough that you can figure out what you have to do? Does it take to long to play? |
| 4 - Error Tolerant | Are there any bugs in the game? Does it run well with a good frame rate?                                                                 |
| 5 - Easy to Learn  | Are the objectives easy enough to understand? Are the controls easy to understand?                                                       |

Listed below are the results to the questions. I will go over the results in depth during the evaluation

### User Feedback

In order to gain some feedback for the user's of my game, I have created a form to ask those who have played my game to fill out for their thoughts and to see what specific aspects worked and what didn't, according to the target audience

### Effective

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (2).png" alt="" width="449"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

This shows some level of divide as to whether the aim of the game was clear to users. Although the majority believe it is clear, some do not agree. However, when asking those who answered no, they do agree that the aim is something that can be figured out here. So while it may not have been clear before entering the game, it did become quickly apparent.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (2) (1).png" alt="" width="428"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

There is some differences here again as to the opinion of the game. Although generally people can understand, some may feel a bit confused. With the puzzle aspect of the game, this is to be expected to an extent, and the majority understanding is positive. I have added text to the levels to aim to prevent some level of this confusion, which seems to have worked. This relates to [criterion 15](3.2-usability-testing.md#usability-requirements-in-success-criteria).

### Efficient

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (10).png" alt="" width="399"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Most people seem to think that the main menu was easy to understand and use, and from my experience of watching, people didn't have issues with trying to accomplish what they wanted to, making this a success. This relates to [criterion 11](3.2-usability-testing.md#usability-requirements-in-success-criteria).

### Engaging

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (9).png" alt="" width="557"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Having all responses for the question, and some being overwhelmingly for the question shows that the levels were puzzling, meeting my requirements for a puzzle game. People had to try and understand what they needed to do on their first play-through, which is probably ultimately what led to this rating. This relates to [criterion 14](3.2-usability-testing.md#usability-requirements-in-success-criteria).

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (12).png" alt="" width="402"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Not everyone played with AI interference on, so this only got 3 responses, however everyone who played with it agreed that it does aim to stop and hamper your progress, which is what it was brought in to do, so it is a success.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (14).png" alt="" width="559"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Being a puzzle game, for the question of how difficult the game is, you do want a score that shouldn't be too low, however, you also probably don't want a score that is too high as players may feel that it was too hard, so a score of 3 and 4 is a good score for my game.

### Error Tolerant

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (6).png" alt="" width="554"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

There is some variance in this result, which is to be expected. People playing on different devices means that results like this are probably expected, however, lag was noted as an issue and one that I did aim to change to reduce it, so those who played earlier may have had slightly higher lag.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (11).png" alt="" width="404"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Only one experience of crashing is good however it would be better being 0. Issues such as lag and crashing have slowly been reduced in my game to improve the player experience, so only one experience that could be on any device is good. I believe that this experience was due to an issue with interacting with an object such as a lever which could cause such bad lag that it could crash, but this has been fixed for quite a bit of time.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (8).png" alt="" width="441"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

This was a big concern with allowing others to play the game, as spawning under the map seemed to be a big issue early on. This was one thing that I instantly aimed at fixing, and did massively reduce the amount of time sit occurred. The same is true for being able to get out of the map, another common issue, and aiming to fix these issues is shown through some players not experiencing anything. This explains why so many players experienced these issues, but I have aimed to reduce this number for newer players.

After this, there was the following question.\


<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (16).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The issues faced here have either been addressed already or is to do with the positions of the cactus or the text error. The cactus has to do with the second minigame, when it would spawn under the map on some resolutions, but this has since been fixed. The text error was an error that I have not been able to understand why it occurred, but I had to remove some text because of it. An issue with a lever is also addressed here, and it is something that has always been a slight issue, however while I have tried to fix it, I believe it may still persist. The results from this testing clearly show that the prevalent bugs are fixed and there are no more that I am aware of currently.

### Easy to Learn

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (19).png" alt="" width="563"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

This shows that players did overwhelmingly agree that the controls were easy to use. Any additional controls are outlined, and the normal and expected WASD keys are used, which is why I think such a positive.

## Usability Requirements in Success Criteria

Some of the success criteria requirements fall into the section of usability. These will also be tested now and are listed below:

| Criterion | Description                                                                                                                                                |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 11        | The most important aspect of the UI is the functionality, and players need to be able to easily understand what they are doing when navigating the menu's. |
| 14        | The game is a puzzle game and gives the player problems they need to solve to progress within the game.                                                    |
| 15        | On top of in game puzzles, there will be minigames that need to be completed that can be started within the map.                                           |
| 18        | As my game is a PEGI 3 game, I should make sure that the content is suitable for this rating.                                                              |
| 22        | Ultimately, the game should be fun and enjoyable for the users, so its important to design the game with this always in mind.                              |
| 23        | There should be music in the game for the enjoyment of the user and to remain engaging.                                                                    |

### Criterion 18

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (23).png" alt="" width="397"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

As shown here all players agree that a PEGI 3 rating is acceptable due to there being no content that would make it deserve a higher rating.

### Criterion  22

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (4).png" alt="" width="554"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

There is some level of split opinion on how fun the game is, however given half of the results are for 4/5, it shows most players do believe the game is fun and enjoyable, and shows that the gameplay is engaging.

### Criterion 23

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (5).png" alt="" width="401"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

This was not a required question since I know that some people may not be able to have the music on if they were somewhere public, however for those that did use it they all said there were no issues.
