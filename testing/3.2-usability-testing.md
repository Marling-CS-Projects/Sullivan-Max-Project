# 3.2 Usability Testing

## Criteria To Assess

| Test               | Test Details                                                                                                                             |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 1 - Effective      | Is the aim of each level easy? Is the aim of the game clear?                                                                             |
| 2 - Efficient      | Is the menu easy to navigate? Are the controls easy to understand?                                                                       |
| 3 - Engaging       | Is it challenging enough to retain players? Is it easy enough that you can figure out what you have to do? Does it take to long to play? |
| 4 - Error Tolerant | Are there any bugs in the game? Does it run well with a good frame rate?                                                                 |
| 5 - Easy to Learn  | Are the objectives easy enough to understand? Are the controls easy to understand?                                                       |

Listed below are the results to the questions. I will go over the results in depth during the evaluation

### User Feedback

In order to gain some feedback for the user's of my game, I have created a form to ask those who have played my game to fill out for their thoughts and to see what specific aspects worked and what didn't, according to the target audience

### Effective

This shows some level of divide as to whether the aim of the game was clear to users. Although the majority believe it is clear, some do not agree. However, when asking those who answered no, they do agree that the aim is something that can be figured out here. So while it may not have been clear before entering the game, it did become quickly apparent.

There is some differences here again as to the opinion of the game. Although generally people can understand, some may feel a bit confused. With the puzzle aspect of the game, this is to be expected to an extant, and the majority understanding is a positive. I have added text to the levels to aim to prevent some level of this confusion, which seems to have worked.

### Efficient

This shows that players did overwhelmingly agree that the controls were easy to use. Any additional controls are outlined, and the normal and expected WASD keys are used, which is why I think such a positive

Most people seem to think that the main menu was easy to understand and use, and from my experience of watching, people didn't have issues with trying to accomplish what they wanted to, making this a success.

### Engaging

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (4).png" alt="" width="554"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

There is some level of split opinion on how fun the game is, however given half of the results are for 4/5, it shows most players do believe the game is fun and enjoyable, and shows that the gameplay is engaging.

This was not a required question since I know that some people may not be able to have the music on if they were somewhere public, however for those that did use it they all said there were no issues.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (9).png" alt="" width="557"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Having all responses for the question, and some being overwahelmingly for shows that the levels were puzzling, meeting my requirements for a puzzle game. People had to try and understand what  they needed to do on their first play through, which is probably ultimately what led to this rating.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (12).png" alt="" width="402"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Not everyone played with AI interference on, so this only got 3 responses, however everyone who played with it agreed that it does aim to stop and hamper your progress, which is what it was brought in to do, so it is a success.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (14).png" alt="" width="559"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Being a puzzle game, for the question of how difficult the game is, you do want a score that shouldn't be too low, however, you also probably dont want a score that is too high as players may feel that it was too hard, so a score fo 3 and 4 is a good score for my game.

### Error Tolerant

There is some variance on this result, which is too be expected. People playin on different devices means that results like this is probably expected, however lag was noted as an issue and one that I did aim to change to reduce it, so those who played earlier may have had slightly higher lag.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (11).png" alt="" width="404"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Only one experience of crashing is good however it would be better being 0. Issues such as lag and crashing have slowly been reduced in my game to improve the player experience, so only one experience that could be on any device is good.

This was a big concern with allowing others to play the game, as spawning under the map seemed to be a big issue early on. This was one thing that I instantly aimed at fixing, and did massively reduce the amount of time sit occurred. The same is true for being able to get out of the map, another common issue, and aiming to fix these issues is shown through some players not experiencing anything. This explains why so many players expereinced these issues, bt I have aimed to reduce this number for newer players.

This was  expected, and this has a follow up question to see about the bugs\

The issues faced here have either been addressed already or is to do with the positions os the cactus or the text error. The cactus is to do with the second minigame

### Easy to Learn

## Usability Requirements in Success Criteria

Some of the success criteria requirements fall into the section of usability. These will also be tested now and are listed below:

| Criterion | Description           |
