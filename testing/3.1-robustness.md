# 3.1 Testing for Function and Robustness

## Criteria To Assess

These are the only success criteria relevant to function and robustness.

| Criterion | Description                                                     |
| --------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 19        | The game should be functional and able to run without crashing. |
| 20        | The game should be able to with a good frame rate               |

### Criterion 19 - The game should run without crashing

The aim of criterion 19 is to ensure that the player can run and progress in the game without any issues occurring that prevent them.

To test this, the game had to be run on several different devices and browsers, to test it meets these requirements in different circumstances.

* The game would struggle to perform more on older and slower computers, which is to be expected of these types of machines. It would take longer to load, and there could be some issues with objects being added, and they could sometimes need to reload.

Another way to test this is by trying to deliberately stress the system, with inputs or actions that could try and break it.
