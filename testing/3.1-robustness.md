# 3.1 Testing for Function and Robustness

## Criteria To Assess

These are the only success criteria relevant to function and robustness.

| Criterion | Description                                                     |
| --------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 19        | The game should be functional and able to run without crashing. |
| 20        | The game should be able to with a good frame rate               |

### Criterion 19 - The game should run without crashing

The aim of criterion 19 is to ensure that the player can run and progress in the game without any issues occurring that prevent them.

To test this, the game had to be run on several different devices and browsers, to test it meets these requirements in different circumstances.

* The game would struggle to perform more on older and slower computers, which is to be expected of these types of machines. It would take longer to load, and there could be some issues with objects being added, and they could sometimes need to reload.
* There was a big issue with the game being run on other resolutions, and while I have tried to fix this, it has proved very challenging to completely fix.

Another way to test this is by trying to deliberately stress the system, with inputs or actions that could try and break it.&#x20;

* The Grungler was a massive issue for this, resulting in a lot of changes being made, however in this time the majority seem to have been fixed, and there are currently no new ones that have been shown to me.

### Criterion 20 - The game should run at a good FPS

The reason for this criterion is to ensure the player can experience the game correctly and not get frustrated by the game experiencing too much lag. There is no set definition for what a good FPS, and it should very device to device, however a benchmark of around 20 to 30 FPS will allow for a good gameplay experience.

In kaboom.js, checking the FPS can be done by entering debug and inspect mode. It will display the FPS and allow to check what the average FPS is, but also if there are any instances where it fluctuates.
