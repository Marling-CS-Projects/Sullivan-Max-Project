### Evidence

In this video there are white patches. These are from the recording and not from the gameplay, and I do not know why it happened.\

## Cycle 8

### Tests

## Cycle 9

### Tests

### Evidence

This video only shows two instances of AI inteference, as showcasing all of them would lead to a very long video. However I hope from this video it is shown what the impact of AI inteference is, in hindering the player.
