# 2.2.4 Cycle 4: Minigames

### Design

In this cycle I want to have 3 minigames prepared that should be able to be played, and work when transitioning from the map. These minigames should be focused on being puzzles, but also have ways of adding interaction from another player, even if that isn't added in this cycle.

### Objectives

* [ ] Have the first minigame completed
* [ ] Have the second minigame completed&#x20;
* [ ] Have the third minigame completed
* [ ] Make sure they work when transitioning from a game environment to the minigame

### Usability Features

To make these minigames fun and enjoyable they need to be engaging in their gameplay. They also need to be easy to understand, especially since they are a different environment to the rest of the game and to other minigames, and so any objectives or rules that are not obvious should be explained. In the interest of the user replaying the game, having the minigames be randomly generated in someway would be necessary, so they are engaging.
