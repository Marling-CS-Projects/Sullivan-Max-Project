# 2.2.8 Cycle 8: Adding Characters (and change of plans)

### Design

In this cycle, I want to add two characters to my game that do different things to add some more variance to the game, as well as add more content. These characters need to be easy to understand in their gameplay differences and abilities so the players know what they are doing. The two characters that are being added are a character that allows for an increased movement speed and one that allows the player to propel themselves. The idea for characters being added was not one that originally going to be implemented, however, multiplayer proved too difficult to be added, so I had to settle for it being single-player, however, I want to add as a response to this.

* [x] Create the design for two characters
* [x] Design what they do in gameplay

### Usability Features

The characters have to be easy to understand in the advantages they bring the player by choosing them. They also have to be error tolerant, so that the abilities do not cause any unexpected potential outcomes.

### Key Variables

| Variable Name    | Use                                                                                           |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| characterSpeed   | This is the speed at which the character moves, and can be changed depending on the character |
| lastKeyPressTime | Determines when the last time an ability was used                                             |
| delay            | The amount of time until that ability can be used again                                       |
| forceStrength    | The strength of the force that propels the character                                          |
| forceDirection   | The direction of the force as a vector                                                        |
| finalCharacter   | The chosen character by the player                                                            |

### Pseudocode

```
        const delay = 15 seconds;

        if (finalCharacter = character1) {
            characterSpeed = 350;
        } else if (finalCharacter = character2) {
            characterSpeed = 300;
            on key press space
                currentTime = time.now
                if (currentTime - lastKeyPressTime >= delay) {
                    lastKeyPressTime = currentTime;
                    forceStrength = ;
                    forceDirection = vector(2, -1);
                    character.move(forceDirection by (forceStrength));
                }
            }
```

## Development

### Outcome

The outcome is now two unique characters that do different things when played in the game. These effects are continuous and are in every scene of the game except for the minigames.&#x20;

```javascript
        let characterSpeed;
        let lastKeyPressTime = 0;
        const delay = 15000;                //15 seconds
```

These are variables relevant to the gameplay of the characters. finalCharacter is not defined here, as it will be defined in the main menu select screen.

```javascript
        if (finalCharacter === "rat") {
            characterSpeed = 350;
        } else if (finalCharacter === "grungler") {
            characterSpeed = 300;
            onKeyPress("space", () => {
                const currentTime = Date.now();
                if (currentTime - lastKeyPressTime >= delay) {
                    lastKeyPressTime = currentTime;
                    const forceStrength = 50000;
                    const forceDirection = vec2(2, -1);     //right 2, up 1
                    character.move(forceDirection.scale(forceStrength));
                }
            });
        }
```

"rat" and "grungler" here refer to the names of the sprites, with rat increasing movement speed and grungler having the propel ability. The values here of 350 movement speed and 50,000 forceStrength could change if they prove to be too unbalanced

### Challenges

The main challenge was the grungler and their ability. Coding it was somewhat of a challenge, but the bigger issue will likely be ensuring there are no game-breaking bugs or issues that would prevent the player from finishing the game.

### Tests
