# 2.2.5.b Cycle 5b: Continuing with the second half of Cycle 5

## Design

This is part of cycle 5 which has been split into 2 since it is such a big cycle. This part will focus on the second half of the second path available to the player. For this part, I want to ensure the puzzle is more complicated so that the experience for both paths is similar, so neither side is advantageous to get.

### Objectives

* [x] Add more to the map
* [x] Add a more complex puzzle&#x20;
* [x] Ensure that there is some element of randomness

### Usability Features

The level and the puzzle needs to be engaging to keep the player's interest. It also needs to be easy to learn, since it will be a more complex puzzle and so it is important that the player can understand what they are doing. It also needs to be error tolerant, to prevent any potential issues that stop the player.

### Key Variables

| Variable Name | Use                                                                                                                   |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| blocks        | This is used to refer to the many components that make up the big block that is the main puzzle in the level          |
| lever1        | This is a lever that is already there and  interacts with the block, by destroying either half of it                  |
| lever2        | This is a second lever that is already there, which by itself does nothing but does do something combined with lever1 |
| partx         | This tracks the position of the levers                                                                                |
| button        | This a third sprite that is added as a part of the puzzle to gain access to the box in the centre                     |
| partxDone     | These track whether each part of the puzzle has been completed, so only the next part will be available.              |
| box           | This is shown in the centre of the block that the player is trying to access to get to the new scene                  |

## Development

### Outcome

The outcome is a puzzle that is more complex while still meeting my usability features. There features of randomness for replayability for the player as well.

```javascript
        character.onCollide("lever1", () => {    //always alternates outside blocks
            if (part1 === 0) {
                onKeyPress("e", () => {
                    destroy(topBlock);
                    destroy(bottomBlock);
                    destroy(sideBlock);
                    destroy(sideBlock2);
                    part1 = 1;
                    destroy(lever1);
                    lever1 = add([
                        sprite("leverPressed"),
                        pos(6700, -95),
                        area(80, 80),
                        body({ isStatic: true }),
                        scale(16),
                        opacity(1),
                        "lever1"
                    ])
                    sideBlock = add([
                        rect(300, 400),
                        pos(7800, -700),
                        outline(4),
                        area(), 
                        body({isStatic: true}),   
                        color(50,432,23),
                    ])            
                    sideBlock2 = add([
                        rect(300, 400),
                        pos(8500, -700),
                        outline(4),
                        area(), 
                        body({isStatic: true}),   
                        color(50,432,23),
                    ])
                    checkConditions1()
                })
            } else if (part1 === 1) {
                onKeyPress("e", () => {
                    destroy(topBlock);
                    destroy(bottomBlock);
                    destroy(sideBlock);
                    destroy(sideBlock2);
                    part1 = 0;
                    destroy(lever1);
                    lever1 = add([
                        sprite("lever"),
                        pos(6700, -95),
                        area(80, 80),
                        body({ isStatic: true }),
                        scale(16),
                        opacity(1),
                        "lever1"
                    ])
                    bottomBlock = add([
                        rect(1000, 300),
                        pos(7800, -300),
                        outline(4),
                        area(), 
                        body({isStatic: true}),   
                        color(50,432,23),
                    ])
            
                    topBlock = add([
                        rect(1000, 300),
                        pos(7800, -1000),
                        outline(4),
                        area(), 
                        body({isStatic: true}),   
                        color(50,432,23),
                    ])
                    checkConditions1()
                })
            }
        })
```

This is the code for interacting with lever1, and as you can see part1 changes, the lever changes sprite, and all Blocks are destroyed, with some being added again. The lever2 interaction is the sdoesn'tcept it doesnt change any of the blocks.

```javascript
        function checkConditions1() {       //function to add button
            if (part1 === rand1 && part2 === rand2 && part2Done === true) {
                destroy(innerSideBlock);
                destroy(innerSideBlock2);
                newRandNum = true;
                button = add([
                    sprite("button"),
                    pos(7500, -35),
                    area(80, 80),
                    body({ isStatic: true }),
                    scale(12),
                    opacity(1),
                    "button"
                ]) 
            }
        }
```

The function checkConditions1 is checked at the end of every interaction with lever1 or lever2. When part1 and part2 equal their random numbers and part2Done is true so that the player has interacted with lever2, then they will have deleted blocks on either side of the box. The deleted ones can be changed through interacting with lever1, but two blocks will always be deleted. A button is also added that is relevant for finally getting access to the box.

```javascript
        character.onCollide("button", () => {     
            part3Done = true;
            checkConditions2()
        })
        
        function checkConditions2() {      //to get to end
            if (part1 === newRand1 && part2 === newRand2 && part3Done === true) {
                destroy(innerBottomBlock);
                destroy(innerTopBlock);
                part4Done = true;
            }
        }
```

This the code relevant to the button and to finishing the puzzle. part3Done is used to check the player has actually touched the button, as otherwise, they could complete the level immediately.&#x20;

### Challenges

There were a few challenges, as there were often issues with having blocks be destroyed when they were supposed to be, and so variables part2Done and part3Done were added to prevent this. Similar to the other path, I encountered an issue with adding a lever inside of a function, and so quickly switched to a button as to not get hung up on it again.
