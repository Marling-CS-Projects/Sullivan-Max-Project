# 2.2.6 Cycle 6: Minigames

### Design

In this cycle I want to have minigames prepared that should be able to be played, and work when transitioning from the map. These minigames should be focused on being puzzles, but also have ways of adding interaction from another player, even if that isn't added in this cycle.

### Objectives

* [x] Have the first minigame completed
* [x] Make sure the minigame is random&#x20;
* [x] Make sure the minigame is engaging

### Usability Features

To make these minigames fun and enjoyable they need to be engaging in their gameplay. They also need to be easy to understand, especially since they are a different environment to the rest of the game and to other minigames, and so any objectives or rules that are not obvious should be explained. In the interest of the user replaying the game, having the minigames be randomly generated in some way would be necessary, so they are engaging.

### Key Variables

| Variable Name       | Use                                                                                                                                                           |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| randomValue         | A random value is used to determine what sprite is added                                                                                                      |
| randomX and randNum | These are also random values used but with regards to the sprite this time. randomX is for the position and randNum is for the scale or how big the sprite is |
| objectEnd           | How many objects need to be dodged in total                                                                                                                   |
| objectCount         | How many objects have been dodged                                                                                                                             |

### Pseudocode

```
Set randomValue to 0
Set objectEnd to 15
Set objectCount to 0
Calculate leftToDodge as objectEnd minus objectCount

Create dodgeText as a text element displaying "Objects left to dodge:" concatenated with leftToDodge, with a font size of 24, positioned at (screenWidth / 2 - 200, 500), and colored black.

Set screenWidth to the width of the screen

Declare fallingObject

Function addObject:
    Generate a random value and store it in randomValue
    Determine chosenSprite based on randomValue
    Generate a random X-coordinate within a range
    Generate a random scale value within a range

    Add fallingObject:
        Use the sprite specified by chosenSprite
        Position it at (randomX, -700)
        Make it an area and add a physics body
        Scale it by randNum
        Assign it a unique name using objectCount

    Increase objectCount by 1

    When fallingObject collides with the floor, destroy it

    When the character collides with an object based on objectCount, destroy the object and decrease objectCount by 3

    Calculate leftToDodge as objectEnd minus objectCount

    Destroy the previous dodgeText

    Create a new dodgeText displaying "Objects left to dodge:" concatenated with leftToDodge, with a font size of 24, positioned at (screenWidth / 2 - 200, 500), and colored black

    If objectCount is less than objectEnd, call addObject recursively

Call addObject
```

## Development

### Outcome

The outcome is then a minigame where the player has to dodge falling objects. It meets my usability features&#x20;

### Challenges



### Tests

| Test | Instructions | What I expect | What actually happens | Pass/Fail |
| ---- | ------------ | ------------- | --------------------- | --------- |
| 1    |              |               |                       | Pass      |
| 2    |              |               |                       | Pass      |
| 3    |              |               |                       | Pass      |
| 4    |              |               |                       | Fail      |
| 5    |              |               |                       | Fail      |
