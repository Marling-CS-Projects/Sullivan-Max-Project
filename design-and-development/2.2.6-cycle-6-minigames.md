# 2.2.6 Cycle 6: Minigames

### Design

In this cycle I want to have minigames prepared that should be able to be played, and work when transitioning from the map. These minigames should be focused on being puzzles, but also have ways of adding interaction from another player, even if that isn't added in this cycle.

### Objectives

* [x] Have the first minigame completed
* [x] Make sure the minigame is random&#x20;
* [x] Make sure the minigame is engaging

### Usability Features

To make these minigames fun and enjoyable they need to be engaging in their gameplay. They also need to be easy to understand, especially since they are a different environment to the rest of the game and to other minigames, and so any objectives or rules that are not obvious should be explained. In the interest of the user replaying the game, having the minigames be randomly generated in some way would be necessary, so they are engaging.

### Key Variables

| Variable Name       | Use                                                                                                                                                           |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| randomValue         | A random value is used to determine what sprite is added                                                                                                      |
| randomX and randNum | These are also random values used but with regards to the sprite this time. randomX is for the position and randNum is for the scale or how big the sprite is |
| objectEnd           | How many objects need to be dodged in total                                                                                                                   |
| objectCount         | How many objects have been dodged                                                                                                                             |
| dodgeText           | Text which is shown on screen displaying how many objects are left to be dodged                                                                               |

### Pseudocode

```
Set randomValue to 0
Set objectEnd to 15
Set objectCount to 0
Calculate leftToDodge as objectEnd minus objectCount

Create dodgeText as a text element displaying "Objects left to dodge:" concatenated with leftToDodge, with a font size of 24, positioned at (screenWidth / 2 - 200, 500), and colored black.

Set screenWidth to the width of the screen

Declare fallingObject

Function addObject:
    Generate a random value and store it in randomValue
    Determine chosenSprite based on randomValue
    Generate a random X-coordinate within a range
    Generate a random scale value within a range

    Add fallingObject:
        Use the sprite specified by chosenSprite
        Position it at (randomX, -700)
        Make it an area and add a physics body
        Scale it by randNum
        Assign it a unique name using objectCount

    Increase objectCount by 1

    When fallingObject collides with the floor, destroy it

    When the character collides with an object based on objectCount, destroy the object and decrease objectCount by 3

    Calculate leftToDodge as objectEnd minus objectCount

    Destroy the previous dodgeText

    Create a new dodgeText displaying "Objects left to dodge:" concatenated with leftToDodge, with a font size of 24, positioned at (screenWidth / 2 - 200, 500), and colored black

    If objectCount is less than objectEnd, call addObject recursively

Call addObject
```

## Development

### Outcome

The outcome is then a minigame where the player has to dodge falling objects. It meets my usability features and incorporates many aspects of randomness.

```
        async function addObject() {
          const randomValue = Math.random();
          let chosenSprite;
          if (randomValue < 0.31) {
            chosenSprite = "box"; 
          } else if (randomValue < 0.62) {
            chosenSprite = "button"; 
          } else if (randomValue < 0.93) {
            chosenSprite = "lever"; 
          } else {
            chosenSprite = "object1"; 
          }
          
          const randomX = (Math.random() * 1200) + 100;    
          const randNum = Math.floor(Math.random() * (26 - 8 + 1)) + 8;
        
          const fallingObject = add([
            sprite(chosenSprite),
            pos(randomX, -700), // Place sprite at the top of the screen
            area(),
            body(),
            scale(randNum),
            "fallingObject" + objectCount,
          ]);
          
          objectCount = objectCount + 1;
```

This is the main function addObject, which initially randomly decides a new sprite to be added, and then randomises the values for the sprite which is added. Other values such as objectEnd and objectCount are declared before.

```
            fallingObject.onCollide("floor", () => {
                destroy(fallingObject);
              })
    
            character.onCollide("fallingObject" + objectCount, (obj) => {
                destroy(obj);
                objectCount = objectCount - 3;
            })
```

This code means the objects are destroyed on contact with something, so that objects dont build up and make it harder.

```
            leftToDodge = objectEnd - objectCount;

            destroy(dodgeText);

            dodgeText = add([
                text("Objects left to dodge:" + leftToDodge, 24),
                pos(width()/2 - 200, 500),
                color(0, 0, 0),
            ])
```

And here is the code for the text displayed.

```
          if (objectCount < objectEnd) {
            addObject();
          }
```

The function will recur until objectCount isn't less than objectEnd, at which point they will go to the next scene.

### Challenges

There were a few challenges in the code. The main issue was the objects not being destroyed, hence why in the code for the objects the final line has the variable objectCount as a part of it. This is to distinguish the objects, so that due to the gap not being big enough between objects being added, they will still be destroyed. Other than that main issue, making sure the objects are in the gap, and not stuck outside.

### Tests

| Test | Instructions                                                 | What I expect                                                                           | What actually happens                                                            | Pass/Fail |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------- |
| 1    | Set up the basic aspects of the map                          | The floor and some barriers to be added, and the player in the centre                   | As expected                                                                      | Pass      |
| 2    | Declare variables and be able to add an object               | To have a random object fall with random properties                                     | As expected                                                                      | Pass      |
| 3    | To have the objects be able to be destroyed                  | Whenever an object collides with something, it should be destroyed                      | Didn't work, as a new object would be added before the first would be destroyed. | Fail      |
| 4    | Add text so the player knows how long they have to go.       | The text should be displayed in the centre of the screen and changed on                 | As expected                                                                      | Pass      |
| 5    | Be able to finish the minigame and thus go to the next scene | If objectCount is not less than objectEnd, stop adding objects and go to the next scene | As expected                                                                      | Pass      |
