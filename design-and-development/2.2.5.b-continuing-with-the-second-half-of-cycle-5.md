# 2.2.5.b Continuing with the second half of Cycle 5

## Design

This is part of cycle 5 which has been split into 2 since it is such a big cycle. This part will focus on the second half of the second path available to the player. For this part, I want to ensure the puzzle is more complicated so that the experience for both paths is similar, so neither side is advantageous to get.

### Objectives

* [x] Add more to the map
* [x] Add a more complex puzzle&#x20;
* [x] Ensure that there is some element of randomness

### Usability Features

The level and the puzzle needs to be engaging to keep the player's interest. It also needs to be easy to learn, since it will be a more complex puzzle and so it is important that the player can understand what they are doing. It also needs to be error tolerant, to prevent any potential issues that stop the player.

### Key Variables

| Variable Name | Use                                                                                                                   |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| blocks        | This is used to refer to the many components that make up the big block that is the main puzzle in the level          |
| lever1        | This is a lever that is already there and  interacts with the block, by destroying either half of it                  |
| lever2        | This is a second lever that is already there, which by itself does nothing but does do something combined with lever1 |
| partx         | This tracks the position of the levers                                                                                |

| box           |                                                                                                                       |
