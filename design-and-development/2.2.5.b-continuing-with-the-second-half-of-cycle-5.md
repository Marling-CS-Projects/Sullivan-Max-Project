# 2.2.5.b Continuing with the second half of Cycle 5

## Design

This is part of cycle 5 which has been split into 2 since it is such a big cycle. This part will focus on the second half of the second path available to the player. For this part, I want to ensure the puzzle is more complicated so that the experience for both paths is similar, so neither side is advantageous to get.

### Objectives

* [x] Add more to the map
* [x] Add a more complex puzzle&#x20;
* [x] Ensure that there is some element of randomness

### Usability Features

The level and the puzzle needs to be engaging to keep the player's interest. It also needs to be easy to learn, since it will be a more complex puzzle and so it is important that the player can understand what they are doing. It also needs to be error tolerant, to prevent any potential issues that stop the player.

### Key Variables

| Variable Name | Use                                                                                                                   |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| blocks        | This is used to refer to the many components that make up the big block that is the main puzzle in the level          |
| lever1        | This is a lever that is already there and  interacts with the block, by destroying either half of it                  |
| lever2        | This is a second lever that is already there, which by itself does nothing but does do something combined with lever1 |
| partx         | This tracks the position of the levers                                                                                |
| button        | This a third sprite that is added as a part of the puzzle to gain access to the box in the centre                     |
| partxDone     | These track whether each part of the puzzle has been completed, so                                                    |
| box           | This is shown in the centre of the block that the player is trying to access to get to the new scene                  |

### Pseudocode

<pre><code><strong>When the character collides with lever1
</strong>    If part1 is false
        When the e key is pressed
            Destroy topBlock
            Destroy bottomBlock
            Set part1 to true
            Change to leverPressed sprite
            Check conditions1

    If part1 is true
        When the e key is pressed
            Destroy sideBlock
            Destroy sideBlock2
            Set part1 to false
            Change to a lever sprite
            Check conditions1

Set part2 to false
Set part2Done to not been added

When the character collides with lever2
    If part2 is false
        When the "e" key is pressed
            Set part2 to true
            Change to a leverPressed sprite
            Set part2Done to has been added
            Check conditions1

    If part2 is true
        When the e key is pressed
            Set part2 to false
            Change to a lever sprite
            Check conditions1

Add a lever3 sprite

Set rand1 to a random number between 0 and 1
Set rand2 to a random number between 0 and 1
Set rand3 to false

Set newRandNum to not been added

When checking conditions1
    If part1 is equal to rand1 and part2 is equal to rand2 and part2Done has been added
        Destroy innerSideBlock
        Destroy innerSideBlock2
        Set newRandNum to has been added
        Add a button sprite

Set part3Done to not been added
Set part3 to false

Set newRand1 to a random number between 0 and 1
Set newRand2 to a random number between 0 and 1

When the character collides with the button
    Set part3Done to has been added
    Check conditions2

Set part4Done to not been added

When checking conditions2
    If part1 is equal to newRand1 and part2 is equal to newRand2 and part3Done has been added
        Destroy innerBottomBlock
        Destroy innerTopBlock
        Set part4Done to has been added

When the character collides with the box
    If part4Done has been added
        When the e key is pressed
            Go to next scene
