# 2.2.10 Cycle 10: Adding a main menu

### Design

To aim to try and bring together the aspects of my game so far, a main menu is an appropriate way to try and bring these aspects together to give the player a choice on how they want to play including which character they want and whether they want AI on.

* [x] Create a clean design for the main menu
* [x] Allow the player to choose a character
* [x] Allow the player to choose whether to have AI on
* [x] Allow for any additional scenes or features

### Usability Features

One of the most important usability features for this scene is to have the design by easy to understand so the player knows how to do what they wish on this main menu. However the main menu also needs to be efficient since a user wouldn't want to be stuck on the main menu for ages, and therefore can meet their requirements.
