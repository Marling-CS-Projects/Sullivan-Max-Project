# 2.2.10 Cycle 10: Adding a main menu

### Design

To aim to try and bring together the aspects of my game so far, a main menu is an appropriate way to try and bring these aspects together to give the player a choice on how they want to play including which character they want and whether they want AI on.

* [x] Create a clean design for the main menu
* [x] Allow the player to choose a character
* [x] Allow the player to choose whether to have AI on
* [x] Allow for any additional scenes or features

### Usability Features

One of the most important usability features for this scene is to have the design by easy to understand so the player knows how to do what they wish on this main menu. However the main menu also needs to be efficient since a user wouldn't want to be stuck on the main menu for ages, and therefore can meet their requirements.

### Key Variables

| Variable Name  | Use                                                                                             |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| finalCharacter | The final character chosen by the player                                                        |
| finalSprite    | Corresponding to the final character a final sprite is chosen to give the player that character |
| AIsetting      | Whether the player wants AI interference on or off                                              |
| characterText  | The text about what the character's name is                                                     |
| characterInfo  | The text about the character's abilities                                                        |

### Pseudocode

```
scene(mainMenu) {
    add(character)
    add(text: press tab to change character)
    add(text: characterText)
    add(text: characterInfo)
    onKeyPress(tab) {
        change character
    }
    add(text: AI inteference is currently, + AIsetting)
    add(Press R to change)
    onKeyPress(r) {
        change AIinteference
    }
    add(text: Play)
        area(cursor: Pointer)
    onClick(Play) {
        go(firstScene)
    }
    add(text: Credits)
        area(cursor: Pointer)
    onClick(Credits) {
        go(Credits)
    }
}
```

## Development

### Outcome

The outcome is now a main menu screen that allows the player to make choices about their gameplay.

```
        let characterText = add([
            text("Biggie Cheese", {
                size: 60,
            }),
            pos(width()/4 - 200, height() / 2 - 200),
            area(),
        ]);

        let character = add([
            sprite("character"),
            pos(height() / 2 - 100, width() / 4-100),
            area(),
            scale(0.5),
            z(10),
        ]);
        
        let characterInfo = add([
            text("Moves faster", {
                size: 60,
            }),
            pos(width() / 4 - 200 , 3 * height() / 4 - 100),
            area(),
        ]);
        
        let flavourText = add([
            text("Oh boy, it's so dark in here", {
                size: 45,
            }),
            pos(width() / 2 - 300, height() / 2  - 20),
            area(),
        ])
        
        let characterChoice = "rat";
```

This defines the variables when first entering the scene. Pressing tab will change these values and add the new sprites.

```
        const playButton = add([
            text("Play", {
                size: 75,
            }),
            pos(3 * width() / 4, height() / 4 - 100),
            area({ cursor: "pointer" }),
            z(10),
        ]);
```

Is the play button

```
        playButton.onClick(() => {
            finalCharacter = characterChoice;
            if (finalCharacter === "rat") {
                finalSprite = "character";
            } else if (finalCharacter === "grungler") {
                finalSprite = "character2";
            }
            go("FirstScene");  //should be FirstScene
        });
```

And this allows them to then go to the first scene when pressing the button. This code is then replicated for the credits scene, with that scene also having an option to go back.

### Challenges

The main challenges were with regards to ensuring that the menu meets my usability features, so that the user can understand what to do to get what they want for when the play. This then requires the placement of these aspects to be organised in a way that the user can achieve this. Also meeting the usability feature of the design being efficent meant that I wanted to allow the user to be able to play immediately if they wanted to, but also meant that not too much of the screen should be covered, so even if it is their first time playing, they can be efficient
