# 2.2.5 Finishing the map (completing the second path)

### Design

For this cycle, I want to move onto the second possible path the player can have, and this cycle will deal with the first half of this path. This cycle will be very similar to [2.2.4](2.2.4-cycle-4-further-development-for-the-first-path.md), and so I want to have puzzles that shouldn't be too complex and generally adding to the map.

### Objectives

* [x] Add more to the map
* [x] Add some more puzzles into the game
* [x] Incorporate some elements of AI&#x20;

### Usability Features

The puzzle needs to be engaging and not too repetitive and easy to learn so players can make it through. It also needs to be error-tolerant so that players cant get stuck out of the game and be unable to progress

### Key Variables

| Variable Name  | Use                                                                                                                |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| lever1         | The first lever that is immediately present                                                                        |
| lever2         | A second lever that can be accessed after creating the path                                                        |
| partx          | partx is used to define the position of the levers, which is relevant for the puzzles                              |
| bottomHalf     | The bottom half of a large block prevents the player from moving far. Can be destroyed by interacting with lever1. |
| beam           | Holds up teleporter1 and is destroyed to allow the player to interact with the teleporter.                         |
| teleporter     | Teleporters are there but out of reach and will then drop and be available to go to the end                        |
| teleporterUsed | This variable determines whether the teleporter has been used so that they cant repeatedly use it.                 |

### Pseudocode

```
Set count to 0

When the character collides with lever
    When the e key is pressed
        If count is 0
            Set count to 1
            Destroy bottomHalf
            Change to leverPressed sprite

When the character collides with lever2
    When the e key is pressed
        If count is 1
            Set count to 2
            Change to a leverPressed sprite
            Add a teleporter1 sprite

When the character collides with lever
    When count is 2
        When the e key is pressed
            Set count to 3
            Destroy beam
            Add a lever sprite

When the character collides with teleporter1
    When the e key is pressed
        If count is 3
            If teleporterUsed is not been added
                Set count to 4
                Set teleporterUsed to has been added
                Move the character to new coordinates 

When the character collides with teleporter2
    Destroy barrier2
    Add a rectangle
    Add a box sprite


When the character collides with box
    When the e key is pressed
        Go to next scene


```

## Development

### Outcome

The outcome is a puzzle that isnt too complex and also has the elements of randomness that allow for some element of replayability. It also shouldnt be possible to make it so you are unable to complete the puzzle.

```
        character.onCollide("lever", () => {
            if (count === 2) {
                onKeyPress("e", () => {
                    count = 3;
                    destroy(lever);
                    destroy(beam);
                    lever = add([
                        sprite("lever"),
                        pos(2100, -95),
                        area(80, 80),
                        body({ isStatic: true }),
                        scale(16),
                        opacity(1),
                        "lever"
                    ])
                })
            }
        })
```

A lot of the code looks like it does above, where it is about interacting with a lever to add or destroy something.

```
        character.onCollide("teleporter1", () => {
            onKeyPress("e", () => {
                if (count === 3) {
                    if (teleporterUsed === false) {
                        count = 4;
                        teleporterUsed = true;
                        character.pos.x = 3800;
                        character.pos.y = -2095;
                    }
                }
            })
        })
```

The player can then teleport to teleporter2 which is at those coordinates.

```
         character.onCollide("teleporter2", async () => {
            await wait(1.5),
                destroy(barrier2);
            await wait(1.2),
                add([
                    rect(300, 100),
                    pos(4400, -2000),
                    outline(4),
                    area(), 
                    body({ isStatic: true }),   
                    color(94, 1, 2), 
                ])
            await wait (1),
                box = add([
                    sprite("box"),
                    pos(5000, -2100),             
                    area(),
                    body(),
                    scale(12),
                    "box"
                ])
        })
```

This gives the player access to the box, where the barriers they are surrounded by when they go to teleporter2 are destroyed and they get access to the box.

### Challenges

The main challenge was an issue where when the player would go to teleporter2, when they would press e to do anything, such as interact with the box, they would be reset to teleporter2, and therefore be unable to continue in the level. A change to the teleporterUsed variable fixed this. Teleporter1 could be added in the wrong place, being under the beam and therefore potentially stopping the player, and this was fixed by defining the teleporter inside a function. Other than that, there were some brief issues with the levers not working as intended, but this wasn't too much of an issue.
