# 2.2.11 Cycle 11: Adding a timer and adding Music

### Design

In this final cycle I aim to try and give the player a time for their run, so that they can then understand how they did. On top of this I want to add more design elements such as music to try and make the game more complete. Music should be playing during most scenes, but should aim to not be too obnoxious.

* [x] Add a timer
* [x] Add a scene where the player gets their time
* [x] Add music to all scenes

### Usability Features

The usability features relevant to this cycle will be ensuring that music and any sound effects added are engaging. There is also making the timer and needing to then display the timer, and to convey what it is, hence efficiency is important.

### Key Variables

| Variable Name | Use                                                |
| ------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| timer         | Holds the time of the player that gets incremented |
| finalTime     | The final time of the player                       |
| menuMusic     | Music to play during the menu                      |
| victoryTheme  | Music to play when they finish the game            |

### Pseudocode

```
    load music
    run music
    
    function startTimer() {
        timerInterval = setInterval(
            timer ++;
        )
    }
    
    function getTimerValue() {
        return finalTime;
    }
```

## Development

### Outcome

The outcome of this cycle is then the addition of music and a timer which is displayed in a new scene once they have finished.

```
        let music = play("menuMusic", {loop: true, volume: 0.3}); 
```

This is the scene for the main menu, but this represents the same for all sound in the game, although they might not be looped and would have a different volume.

```
let timer = 0;
let timerInterval;

function startTimer() {
    timerInterval = setInterval(() => {
        timer += 10; // Update the timer every 10 milliseconds
    }, 10);
 
}

function stopTimer() {
  clearInterval(timerInterval);
}

let finalTime = 0;

function getTimerValue() {
    return timer;
}

export { startTimer, stopTimer, getTimerValue };
```

This is a file that creates the timer, and also exports the functions to be used in other files.

```
            stopTimer(); 
            getTimerValue();    
```

This is then run when the game is completed, and they are then taken to a scene to display this time.

```
        const finalTime = getTimerValue(); // Assumes the timer is in milliseconds
        
        const totalMilliseconds = finalTime % 1000;
        const totalSeconds = Math.floor(finalTime / 1000);
        const totalMinutes = Math.floor(totalSeconds / 60);

        const seconds = totalSeconds % 60;

        const formattedTime = `${String(totalMinutes).padStart(2, '0')}:${String(seconds).padStart(2, '0')}:${String(totalMilliseconds).padStart(2, '0')}`;
```

There is also a button to go back to the main menu in this scene.

### Challenges

The biggest challenge was definitely with regards to getting the timer to work across all the files, and especially with that final code regarding having it formatted it into minutes, seconds and milliseconds.&#x20;
