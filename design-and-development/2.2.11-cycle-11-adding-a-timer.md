# 2.2.11 Cycle 11: Adding a timer and adding Music

### Design

In this final cycle I aim to try and give the player a time for their run, so that they can then understand how they did. On top of this I want to add more design elements such as music to try and make the game more complete. Music should be playing during most scenes, but should aim to not be too obnoxious.

* [x] Add a timer
* [x] Add a scene where the player gets their time
* [x] Add music to all scenes
