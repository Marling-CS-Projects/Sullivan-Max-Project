# 2.2.3 Cycle 3: Setup

### Design

For this cycle I will be using kaboom.js in replit, as I begin to design my actual game. I will be beginning the development of my game, and adding the base of my game that will be fundamental throughout the development. The development will still be very basic in design as I want to focus primarily on functionality at the moment.

### Objectives

* [x] Add some basic platforms
* [x] Add some basic aspects to the game
* [x] Add some objects to the game and the ability to interact&#x20;
* [x] Add some new scenes&#x20;

### Usability Features

I need to make sure the user can easily understand what they need to do if the situation requires it, such as interaction with objects, as it may not be immediately obvious. The game should aim to be somewhat engaging even at such a fundamental level, as it is important that users have fun when playing.

### Key Variables

| Variable Name | Use                                                                             |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| character     | Defines the character, where they start and their name                          |
| box           | Defines the position, name and size of the box                                  |
| graphic       | Defines the position, name and size of the 'E key' graphic used to help players |

### Pseudocode

```
Create character 
entity with a sprite, 
position, 
area, 
body components

Create "World" scene
  - Set up character controls (jumping and movement)
  - Create the floor entity
  - Create the first obstacle entity
  - Create the boundary walls entities
  - Create the box entity
  - Set up collision detection between the character and the box entity
  - Display the Ekey graphic when colliding with the box entity and pressing "e" key

When the character collides with the object
  - If MinigamesCompleted is 0, display the Ekey graphic //if they are up to this point, they will know the key needed
  - If "e" key is pressed, transition to the "World" scene


Transition to the "World" scene

When updating the character's position
  - Update the camera position to follow the character

When "w" key is pressed
  - If the character is grounded, make the character jump
When "d" key is pressed
  - Move the character to the right
When "a" key is pressed
  - Move the character to the left

```

As this cycle does not involve the creation of minigames, interacting with an object (which would go to the minigame), goes to the world after the minigame. MinigamesCompleted is also irrelevant currently.

### Tests

| Test | Instructions | What I expect | What actually happens                                      | Pass/Fail |
| ---- | ------------ | ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- | --------- |
| 1    |              |               | As expected                                                | Pass      |
| 2    |              |               | As expected                                                | Fail      |
| 3    |              |               | As expected                                                | Pass      |
| 4    |              |               | As expected                                                | Pass      |
| 5    |              |               | Error with connecting initially, took a while to then fix. | Fail      |
