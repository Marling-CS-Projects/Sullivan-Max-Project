# 2.2.2 Cycle 2: Login System

## Design

&#x20;In this cycle I want to be designing the login from to allow people to create their account and then use the game. I will need to create a login system for players and have it linked to the database created in [the first cycle](cycle-1.md). It should be able to take the input of the username and password from the players, and if these inputs are wrong in any way (if nothing was entered or the username isn't unique), then it should be flagged and the user shown this, and not able to enter until they have rectified these issues.

### Objectives

* [x] Create the HTML and CSS for the login system
* [x] Connect this to the database
* [ ] Have it tested and ready for use

### Usability Features

To have the system be useable, I need it to be clear to the user about what each step is, and what they need to do, but also needs to be [effective](systems-diagram.md#effective) so thatr it is as easy as possible for them to complete their aim, with the fewest steps psoobile.

## Development

### Outcome



### Challenges

Having to incorporate express.js to connect the database and the rest of my code was challenging as it was a new language to try and briefly understand. There were also issues with trying to run the code on replit, and that the wrong file may display.

### Tests

| Test | Instructions | What I expect | What actually happens                                       | Pass/Fail |
| ---- | ------------ | ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | --------- |
| 1    |              |               | As expected                                                 | Pass      |
| 2    |              |               | Error displayed as it failed to input username and password | Fail      |
| 3    |              |               | As expected                                                 | Pass      |
| 4    |              |               | As expected                                                 | Pass      |
| 5    |              |               | Error displayed due to syntax error                         | Fail      |
