# 2.2.2 Cycle 2; Login System

## Design

&#x20;In this cycle I want to be designing the login from to allow people to create their account and then use the game. I will need to create a login system for players and have it linked to the database created in [the first cycle](cycle-1.md). It should be able to take the input of the username and password from the players, and if these inputs are wrong in any way (if nothing was entered or the username isn't unique), then it should be flagged and the user shown this, and not able to enter until they have rectified these issues.
