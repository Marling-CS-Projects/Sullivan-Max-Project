# 2.2.7 Cycle 7: Adding Multiplayer

### Design

In this cycle I want to add multiplayer, which is a core feature of my game. This cycle won't focus on the impact of what multiplayer will be used for, but only on adding multiplayer. The game will be local multiplayer, meaning it won't be online and only for when there are two players in person together.&#x20;
