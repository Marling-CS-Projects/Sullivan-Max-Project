# 2.2.7 Cycle 7: Adding Multiplayer

### Design

In this cycle I want to add multiplayer, which is a core feature of my game. This cycle won't focus on the impact of what multiplayer will be used for, but only on adding multiplayer. The game will be local multiplayer, meaning it won't be online and only for when there are two players in person together. I will also include the players being able to finish and win, since that is a very important feature in multiplayer

* [ ] Add split screen
* [ ] Ensure gameplay works the same
* [ ] Make sure there is a way to win

### Usability Features

The main usability feature relevant to this cycle is being error-tolerant. The implementation of multiplayer needs to be done so that it is not causing errors or full of bugs for users. It needs to still be accurate and not hinder the gameplay for the individual players, now that it is split screen. Making sure that it is easy to learn, so the player understands what is going on and which side of the screen is theirs is also important for usability.
