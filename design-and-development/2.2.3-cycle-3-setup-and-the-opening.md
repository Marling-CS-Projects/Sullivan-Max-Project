# 2.2.3 Cycle 3: Setup and the opening

### Design

For this cycle I will be using kaboom.js in replit, as I begin to design my actual game. I will be beginning the development of my game, and adding the base of my game that will be fundamental throughout the development. The development will still be very basic in design as I want to focus primarily on functionality at the moment.

### Objectives

* [x] Add some basic platforms
* [x] Add some basic aspects to the game
* [x] Add some objects to the game and the ability to interact&#x20;
* [x] Add some new scenes&#x20;

### Usability Features

I need to make sure the user can easily understand what they need to do if the situation requires it, such as interaction with objects, as it may not be immediately obvious. The game should aim to be somewhat engaging even at such a fundamental level, as it is important that users have fun when playing.

### Key Variables

| Variable Name | Use                                                                             |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| character     | Defines the character, where they start and their name                          |
| box           | Defines the position, name and size of the box                                  |
| graphic       | Defines the position, name and size of the 'E key' graphic used to help players |

### Pseudocode

```
Create character 
entity with a sprite, 
position, 
area, 
body components

Create "World" scene
  - Set up character controls (jumping and movement)
  - Create the floor entity
  - Create the first obstacle entity
  - Create the boundary walls entities
  - Create the box entity
  - Set up collision detection between the character and the box entity
  - Display the Ekey graphic when colliding with the box entity and pressing "e" key

When the character collides with the object
  - If MinigamesCompleted is 0, display the Ekey graphic //if they are up to this point, they will know the key needed
  - If "e" key is pressed, transition to the "World" scene


Transition to the "World" scene

When updating the character's position
  - Update the camera position to follow the character

When "w" key is pressed
  - If the character is grounded, make the character jump
When "d" key is pressed
  - Move the character to the right
When "a" key is pressed
  - Move the character to the left

```

As this cycle does not involve the creation of minigames, interacting with an object (which would go to the minigame), goes to the world after the minigame. MinigamesCompleted is also irrelevant currently.

## Development

### Outcome

The outcome of this cycle is that I have many platforms around that define the map as shown here

```
add([
    rect(100000,1000),    
    pos(0, 0),    
    outline(4),   
    area(),   
    body({isStatic: true}),                        //floor
    color(2,342,200),
]);                                               
        
add([
    rect(width()-1200,1250),  
        pos(1000, height()-1250),   
        outline(4),
        area(),                                   // first obstacle
        body({isStatic: true}),                       
        color(50,432,23),
]);
    
add([                                                
        rect(10000,500),   
        pos(0, height()-2600),  
        outline(4),                                 //height boundary
        area(),   
        body({isStatic: true}),
        color(2,342,200),
]);                                                 

add([
    rect(width(),height()+400),                     //left boundary 
        pos(-width(), -height()-100),
        outline(4),
        area(),
        body({isStatic: true}),
        color(2,342,200),
]);

add([
    rect(1200, 1500),
    pos(2750, -1160),
    outline(4),                                    //wall after the box
    area(),
    body({isStatic: true}),
    color(2,342,200),
])
```

There is also defining the movement of the character and the ketys that need to be pressed, and also following the character with the camera

```
character.onUpdate(() => {                              //camera
  camPos(character.pos);
});

onKeyPress("w", () => {                                //controls
	if (character.isGrounded()) {
		character.jump(800);
	}
});

onKeyDown("d", () => {
    character.move(characterSpeed,0)
})

onKeyDown("a", () => {
    character.move(-characterSpeed,0)
})
```

Here is the defining of the characteristics of the box and 'E key' graphic

```
loadPedit("box", "sprites/box.pedit");

const box = add([            //box
    sprite("box"),
    pos(2500, -100),
    area(),
    body(),
    scale(12),
    "object"
]);


loadPedit("Ekey", "sprites/Ekey.pedit");
    
const graphic = add([        //graphic
    sprite("Ekey"),
    pos(2500, -300),
    opacity(0),
    scale(8),
]);
```

Finally there is for when the character is colliding with the box, and what needs to happen

```
character.onCollide("object", () => {     //go to next world
    if (oneMinigame == 0) {
        graphic.opacity = 1;
        onKeyPress("e", () => {
            go("World");
        });
    }
});
```

The "World" scene involves the same things above, however the first obstacle is raised to prevent going back and the wall after the box is lowered so the player can get through.

### Challenges

The challenges were first of all getting used to the language of kaboom.js, and the syntax required for coding. However other than that there were a few logic errors occurring, especially with regards to the box and the 'E key' graphic. Ensuring that the box had the correct hitbox, and that the correct things happened when the player was colliding with the box.
