# 2.2.4 Cycle 4: Further development for the first path

### Design

In this cycle I want to continue development on the map of my game but also want to use elements of AI to make the experience different for players. I also want to try and add more puzzles considering the game is a puzzle game, and so including this in the actual map would be good.

### Objectives

* [x] Add more to the map
* [x] Try to incorporate more puzzles into my game
* [x] Try to incorporate elements of AI into my game

### Usability Features

The game needs to be engaging in gameplay, and so the use of puzzles and platforms would allow this. The game should aim to have variations so that the game is not the same for both players but also so that the ability to replay for the player is possible, and they won't play the exact same game every time.

### Key Variables

| Variable Name | Use                                                                                   |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| button        | A button that is added as part of the puzzle                                          |
| button2       | A second button that is added as part of the puzzle that requires an action to add it |
| box           | A box that is added as part of the puzzle that requires an action to be met to add it |
| buttonPressed | Determines whether the button has been pressed                                        |
| puzzleDone    | Determines whether the puzzle has been completed                                      |

### Pseudocode

```
//There are some more elements that are in the code but I didnt feel needed to be included since they were adde in previous code
//These include the speed and the camera, and also some platforms 

When the character collides with button:
    If buttonPressed is false:
        buttonPressed to true
        Add a new button  

When the character collides with button2:
    If button2Pressed is false and puzzleDone is true:
        button2Pressed to true
        puzzleDone to false
        Add a box 

When the button collides with the box:
    If puzzleDone is false:
        puzzleDone to true
        When the character collides with button2:
            If puzzleDone is true:
                Go to next scene
```

## Development

### Outcome

The outcome is that the first half of one of the paths, and that contains the elements that I wanted including incorporating puzzles.

```
    let buttonPressed = false;


    character.onCollide("button", () => {            //code to add second button
        if (!buttonPressed) {
            buttonPressed = true;
            add([
                sprite("button"),
                pos(4600, -100),
                area(),
                body(),
                scale(12),
                "button2"
            ]);
        }
    })                        
```

The code above is the code for the first interaction with the button, which is automatically added and the second button that is added.

```
    let button2Pressed = false;
    
    let puzzleDone = true;

    character.onCollide("button2", () => {      //code to add the falling box
      if (!button2Pressed && puzzleDone === true) {
        button2Pressed = true;
          puzzleDone = false
        const box = add([
          sprite("box"),
          pos(4000, -900),
          area(),
          body(),
          scale(12),
            "box"
        ]);
      }
    });
```

This is for the character colliding with the second button that is added before.

```
button.onCollide("box", () => {      //code to go to next level
  if (!puzzleDone) {
    puzzleDone = true;
      character.onCollide("button2", () => {
          if(puzzleDone === true) {
              go("PostPuzzle1");
          }
      })
  }
});
```

This is the final code where you are able to go the next part of the code. It is important to note that this code all has to make sure that the objects of the button and the box are only added once

### Challenges

The challenges were with trying to make sure that it would be a fun and interactive level, as well as some issues with defining sprites inside of other functions, and then interacting with that sprite, however I quickly realised this and so it wasn't too much of an issue.

### Tests

<table><thead><tr><th width="158">Test</th><th>Instructions</th><th>What I expect</th><th>What actually happens</th><th>Pass/Fail</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>1</td><td>Make sure that the platforms and the basic character elements work, as well as going from the previous scene to this one.</td><td>All platforms are added as expected and the transition to the scene works.</td><td>As expected</td><td>Pass</td></tr><tr><td>2</td><td>Add the first button and make it so the second button can be added.</td><td>On contact with the first button the second one is added.</td><td>As expected</td><td>Pass</td></tr><tr><td>3</td><td>The box should be added on contact with the second button.</td><td>A box to be added when  the player collides with the second button.</td><td>As expected </td><td>Pass</td></tr><tr><td>4</td><td>The player should be able to open the final part of this level, when they meet the conditions.</td><td>When the button collides with the first button and the player collides with the second button, the ending is opened.</td><td>Not as expected, as it wouldn't originally open the path and there were issues with the player potentially being unable to complete the task. </td><td>Fail</td></tr></tbody></table>
