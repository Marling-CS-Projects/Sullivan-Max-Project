# 2.2.6.b Cycle 6b: Creating the second minigame

### Design

&#x20;I am dividing this part into multiple cycles, giving each minigame its own cycle. This cycle will focus on the second minigame. This minigame has to be unique to the first, while still holding the same needs of the first minigame of being random and engaging.

### Objectives

* [x] Have the second minigame completed
* [x] Make sure the minigame is random&#x20;
* [x] Make sure the minigame is engaging

### Usability Features

The minigame is a break in between the normal gameplay and needs to be easy to learn for the short time the player is there. It also therefore should be engaging and entertaining as a break, and keep the player's attention. To keep the payer's attention, the game should be error tolerant, to generally have a good quality of gameplay.
