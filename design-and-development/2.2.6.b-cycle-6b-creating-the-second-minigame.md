# 2.2.6.b Cycle 6b: Creating the second minigame

### Design

&#x20;I am dividing this part into multiple cycles, giving each minigame its own cycle. This cycle will focus on the second minigame. This minigame has to be unique to the first, while still holding the same needs of the first minigame of being random and engaging. This minigame will be one where sprites will be added routinely every so often

### Objectives

* [x] Have the second minigame completed
* [x] Make sure the minigame is random&#x20;
* [x] Make sure the minigame is engaging

### Usability Features

The minigame is a break in between the normal gameplay and needs to be easy to learn for the short time the player is there. It also therefore should be engaging and entertaining as a break, and keep the player's attention. To keep the payer's attention, the game should be error tolerant, to generally have a good quality of gameplay.

### Key Variables

| Variable Name | Use                                                                           |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| objectCount   | How many objects have been dodged                                             |
| objectEnd     | How many objects need to be dodged to finish the minigame                     |
| dodgeText     | The text displayed telling the player how many more objects need to be dodged |
| position      | Used to determine the new position                                            |

### Pseudocode

```
Create dodgeText as a text element displaying "Objects left to dodge: 15", with a font size of 24, positioned at (width() / 2 - 200, 300), and colored black.

When character collides with "object":
    Decrease objectCount by 3

Function addObject:
    Calculate randWait as 1 plus a random value
    Wait for randWait seconds

    If objectCount is less than 6:
        Set position to character's X position plus 650
    Else if objectCount is less than 11:
        Set position to character's X position plus 550
    Else if objectCount is less than 16:
        Set position to character's X position plus 450

    Add an object:
        Use the sprite "object1"
        Position it at (position, 700)
        Make it an area and add a physics body
        Scale it by 11
        Assign it a name "object" + objNum

    Destroy the previous dodgeText

    Increase objectCount by 1

    If num is 1:
        Create a new dodgeText displaying "Objects left to dodge: " concatenated with (objectEnd - objectCount), with a font size of 24, positioned at (character's X position + 400, 300), and colored black
        Set num to 0
    Else:
        Set num to 1   //Only adds text every two objects

    If character's X position is greater than position:
        Call addObject
```

## Development

### Outcome

The outcome is then a minigame that meets my usability features.

```
        let dodgeText = add([
            text("Objects left to dodge:" + objectEnd - objectCount, 24),
            pos(width() / 2 - 200, 300),
            color(0, 0, 0),
        ]);
        
        character.onCollide("object", () => {
            objectCount -= 3;
        });
```

This displays the first bit of text, and also sets it up so that a character colliding with an object means objectCount is decreased, meaning more objects have to be dodged.

```
        async function addObject() {
            const randWait = 1 + Math.random();
            await wait(randWait);

            if (objectCount < 6) {
                position = character.pos.x + 650;
            } else if (objectCount < 11) {
                position = character.pos.x + 550;
            } else if (objectCount < 16) {
                position = character.pos.x + 450;
            }
            
            object = add([
                sprite("object1"),
                pos(position, 700), 
                area(),
                body(),
                scale(11),
                "object", 
            ]);
```

This is the start of the function addObject. The distance ahead of the player is decided by how many objects are still left to be dodged, getting progressively harder. There is a randomised wait that ensures there is a big enough gap between the objects.

```
            destroy(dodgeText);

            objectCount += 1;
            
            if (num === 1) {
                dodgeText = add([
                    text("Objects left to dodge: " + (objectEnd - objectCount), 24),
                    pos(character.pos.x + 400, 300),
                    color(0, 0, 0),
                ]);
                num = 0;
            } else {
                num = 1
            }
```

This ensures objectCount is incremented, and that the previous dodgeText is destroyed, and a new text is added every two objects.&#x20;

```
            if (character.pos.x > position) {
                addObject(); // Start generating objects
            } else {
                runAddObject()
            }
            if (objectCount === objectEnd) {
                randNum = Math.floor(Math.random() * 2);
                if (randNum === 0) {
                    go("WorldOne");
                } else if (randNum === 1) {
                    go("WorldTwo");
                }
            }  
        }

        async function runAddObject() {
            if (character.pos.x > position) {
                addObject(); // Start generating objects
            } else {
                await wait(0.00001);
                runAddObject();
            }
        }
```

This is the code ensuring addObject will be called when it's needed. As you can see there is another function runAddObject. This function is there to call addObject only if the player has gone past the object. It is called every 0.00001 seconds, as having no time limit breaks the function, but any time restriction, no matter how small, stops this.

### Challenges

The biggest challenge was making sure addObject is only called when the player has passed the previous object. A strategy similar to the previous minigame of defining each object with a variable that changes wouldn't work, and so eventually just continuously calling a function to check was the only option I had. Another small issue was with the player colliding with the object not causing anything; but with it outside of the function and a previous object added so that object is a recognised variable.
