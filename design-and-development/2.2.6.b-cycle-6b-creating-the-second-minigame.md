# 2.2.6.b Cycle 6b: Creating the second minigame

### Design

&#x20;I am dividing this part into multiple cycles, giving each minigame its own cycle. This cycle will focus on the second minigame. This minigame has to be unique to the first, while still holding the same needs of the first minigame of being random and engaging.

### Objectives

* [x] Have the second minigame completed
* [x] Make sure the minigame is random&#x20;
* [x] Make sure the minigame is engaging

### Usability Features

To make these minigames fun and enjoyable they need to be engaging in their gameplay. They also need to be easy to understand, especially since they are a different environment to the rest of the game and to other minigames, and so any objectives or rules that are not obvious should be explained. In the interest of the user replaying the game, having the minigames be randomly generated in some way would be necessary, so they are engaging.
