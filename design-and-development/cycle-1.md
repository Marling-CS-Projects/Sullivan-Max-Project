# 2.2.1 Cycle 1

## Design

In this first cycle, I want to set up the database I will be using to be able to store the data about the people who play my game. I will need to have a database that can store the usernames and passwords of the accounts of my players, and should be able to add new accounts to it. The usernames should always be unique to others in the database, and both the username and password need to have an input.&#x20;

### Objectives

* [x] Create the database
* [x] Create username and password fields
* [ ] Be able to make changes to the database

### Usability Features

The player needs to be able to create an account [effectively](systems-diagram.md#effective) and [efficiently](systems-diagram.md#efficiency), and be able to know and then meet the requirements.&#x20;

### Key Variables

| Variable Name | Use                                           |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| users         | Stores both the name and password being input |
| name          | The desired username                          |
| password      | The desired password                          |

### Pseudocode
