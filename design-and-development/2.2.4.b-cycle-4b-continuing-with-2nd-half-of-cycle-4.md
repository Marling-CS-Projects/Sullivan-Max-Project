# 2.2.4.b Cycle 4b: Continuing with 2nd half of Cycle 4

### Design

Cycle 4 is being split into 2 cycles since there is two parts to each path, and it would be too big to havea  For this cycle, I want to continue development and make the puzzle in this part more complex and have more of an element of randomness for replay ability for the player so that it can be more enjoyable and also harder for them.

### Objectives

* [x] Add even more to the map
* [x] Try to incorporate more complex puzzles into my game
* [x] Try to incorporate elements of AI into my game

### Usability Features

The game needs to still be engaging, which for this part can be done through harder puzzles, and including randomness into the puzzle means that gameplay won't always be the same. The puzzle needs to balance being complicated while still being easy to learn and understand.

### Key Variables

| Variable Name | Use                                                                                                                                                                     |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| lever1        | The lever that is present when you first go into the map                                                                                                                |
| partx (1,2,3) | This is used multiple times for different sprites to track their position, which is important to solving some of the puzzles                                            |
| randNum       | Since randomness is so important, having a random integer is very important for the values of partx                                                                     |
| lever2        | A second lever is added upon interacting with lever1 that is out of reach of the player although they can see it. It can only be accessed upon the correct part1 value. |
| button        | A button that is added upon interacting with lever1 for a second time                                                                                                   |
| teleporter    | A teleporter that is added when the values of part1 and part2 equal a random value                                                                                      |
| leverBox      | A final lever that is added to gain access to the box                                                                                                                   |
| box           | A box that gives access to the next scene                                                                                                                               |

## Development

### Outcome

The outcome is that there is now a more complicated puzzle based on random values that should be easy enough for a new user to learn and also mean that the experience wont be the same for players every time.

<pre class="language-javascript"><code class="lang-javascript"><strong>        onKeyPress("e", () => {               //code for interacting with lever for part1=1
</strong>            character.onCollide("lever1", () => {
                count = count + 1;
                if (part1 === 0) {
                    destroy(lever1);
                    lever1 = add([
                        sprite("leverPressed"),
                        pos(6000, -95),
                        area(80, 80),
                        body({ isStatic: true }),

                        opacity(1),
                        "lever1"
                    ])
                    part1 = 1
                } else if (part1 === 1) {           //for part1=2
                    destroy(lever1);
                    lever1 = add([
                        sprite("lever"),
                        pos(6000, -95),
                        area(80, 80),

                        scale(16),
                        opacity(1),
                        "lever1"
                    ])
                    part1 = 0;
                }
            })
        })                     
</code></pre>

The code above is the basic code for a lever that changes the appearance and also some other values such as the part values.

```javascript
        character.onCollide("lever1", () => {         //second bit of code for colliding with lever1
            onKeyPress("e", () => {                   //second lever hasnt been added
                if (lever2Added === false) {
                    lever2Added = true;
                    plank1 = add([
                        rect(250, 50),
                        pos(4900, -550),
                        outline(4),
                        area(),
                        body({ isStatic: true }),
                        color(174, 108, 2),
                    ]);
                    plank2 = add([
                        rect(50, 250),
                        pos(5150, -750),
                        outline(4),
                        area(),
                        body({ isStatic: true }),
                        color(174, 108, 2),
                    ]);
                    lever2 = add([
                        sprite("lever"),
                        pos(5000, -645),
                        area(80, 80),
                        scale(16),
                        opacity(1),
                        body(),
                        "lever2",
                    ]);
                } else if (lever3Added === false) {         //3rd lever hasnt been added
                    lever3Added = true;
                    button = add([
                        sprite("button"),
                        pos(5200, -33),
                        area(),
                        body(),
                        scale(12),
                        body({ isStatic: true }),
                        "button"
                    ]);
                }
            })
        })
```

This is the code for interacting with lever1, and lever2 is added in the first interaction along with some planks to hold it up and a button is added on the second interaction.

```javascript
        rand = Math.floor(Math.random() * 2);     //set a random value

        character.onCollide("button", () => {     //check if values are these random values  
            if (count > 3) {
                if (part1 === rand) {
                    destroy(plank1);
                    destroy(plank2);
                }
            }
        })
```

It is important to have the count variable be set to a value such as >3, as otherwise, they can get access to the lever too early.

```javascript
        character.onCollide("button", () => {     //character colliding with button to check if teleporters need to be added
            if (boxAdded === false) {
                if (lever2Done === true) {
                    if (part1 === part1Answer && part2 === part2Answer) {
                        boxAdded = true;
                        Teleporter1 = add([
                            sprite("Teleporter"),
                            pos(4350, -95),
                            area(),
                            body({ isStatic: true }),
                            scale(16),
                            "Teleporter1"
                        ])
                        Teleporter2 = add([
                            sprite("Teleporter"),
                            pos(6500, -795),
                            area(),
                            body({ isStatic: true }),
                            scale(16),
                            "Teleporter2"
                        ])
                    }
                }
            }
        })
```

This is the code to add the teleporters. boxAdded is a variable that means it can only occur once, and lever2Done refers to having lever2 being able to be interacted with by the player, and the values for part1 and part2 needed are random values.

```javascript
        teleporterUsed = false;          //to prevent being able to use the teleporter in other cirumstances
 
        character.onCollide("Teleporter1", () => { //allowing use of the teleporters
            onKeyPress("e", () => {
                if (teleporterUsed === false) {
                    character.pos.x = 6500;
                    character.pos.y = -800;
                    teleporterUsed = true;
                    destroy(leverBox);
                    leverBox = add([
                        sprite("lever"),
                        pos(7150, -395),
                        area(),
                        body(),
                        scale(16),
                        body({ isStatic: true }),
                        "leverBox"
                    ])
                }
            })
        })
```

The player can then use the teleporter to get to the coordinates shown. They can only do it once however there is the possibility to move back down and thus be locked out. Because of this the following code was added.

```javascript
        character.onCollide("teleporter1", () => {
            teleporterUsed = false;
        })
```

### Challenges

The biggest challenge faced was definitely initially trying to use a lever that is added within another function, which ended up making me have to change the lever to a button. Other than that, there were some issues with sprites such as the teleporter and the third lever were a challenge, as well as trying to make sure my puzzle is still easy to understand and try and complete for other players.
