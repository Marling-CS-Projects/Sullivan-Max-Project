# 1.2 Stakeholders

## Customer Role

An important stakeholder in a video game is obviously the customers, since they will purchase and likely play the game. When analyzing what a gamer would want out of a game, it is important to know who the average gamer is.

This graph from (Clement, 2021) shows that the age of gamers are predominantly from under 18 to 34, and in fact the average gamer is 34 years old according to (Yanev, 2019), This shows that a game should probably aim to be modern in it's design as to appeal to this age group, but also that they likely want a game that allows them to have fun, reduce stress and escape the real world. It is therefore important to incorporate this in mind when designing my game, as the game should be captivating enough to hold the gamers attention.&#x20;

It is also important to understand what a user wants out of a game and why they play the game.&#x20;

As (Dsouza, 2021) found, relaxing and passing the time are generally aspects a gamer must feel a game can provide. The importance of puzzles and challenging yourself is also quite important on this list, which is something my game aims to provide. If the game can provide these key elements and can be engaging for its audience, then it should meet the demands of the customer stakeholders.
