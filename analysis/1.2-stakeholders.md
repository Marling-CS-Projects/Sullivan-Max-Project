# 1.2 Stakeholders

## Customer Role

An important stakeholder in a video game is obviously the customers, since they will purchase and likely play the game. When analyzing what a gamer would want out of a game, it is important to know who the average gamer is.

This graph from (Clement, 2021) shows that the age of gamers are predominantly from under 18 to 34, and in fact the average gamer is 34 years old according to (Yanev, 2019), This shows that a game should probably aim to be modern in it's design as to appeal to this age group, but also that they likely want a game that allows them to have fun, reduce stress and escape the real world. It is therefore important to incorporate this in mind when designing my game, as the game should be captivating enough to hold the gamers attention.&#x20;

However there is also that under 18 category. This study from (Clement, 2021) shows that for under 18 gamers, children from ages 8-17 the majority of them have played video games.

The amount of children under 18 playing keeps growing, and as such it would make sense to have the game appeal to them as well, since they are going to be players for this game. Therefore I need to include the needs of this demographic in the game.

It is also important to understand what a user wants out of a game and why they play the game.&#x20;

As (Dsouza, 2021) found, relaxing and passing the time are generally aspects a gamer must feel a game can provide. The importance of puzzles and challenging yourself is also quite important on this list, which is something my game aims to provide. If the game can provide these key elements and can be engaging for its audience, then it should meet the demands of the customer stakeholders.

## Demographics

The Pan European Game Information or PEGI is there to set age ratings for games based on their content, as to help parents discern what they want their children playing games with. It is important to note that these labels regard the content, not the difficulty of the game.

PEGI 3 games should be suitable for all age groups, with nothing to frighten younger players and a very minimal amount of violence which should be in a childlike or comical setting. PEGI 7 games could have some forms of violence and some scenes that could be frightening. From this description I think that a PEGI rating of 3 would be suitable, since there shouldn't be any scenes or forms of violence that could be frightening for a younger audience, and given younger audiences are a big part of the target demographic for the game, a rating of 3 allows almost everyone to play.
