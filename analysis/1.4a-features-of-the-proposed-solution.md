# 1.4a Features of Proposed Solution

## Mechanics

### Movement

The characters will move at a constant speed without acceleration. This will give the user more control as their character will use at the same speed at all times, and mean that they can focus on puzzles rather than worrying about managing the speed of their character.

### Controls

The game will use the WASD controls to allow the characters to move, which is very common for games utilising a keyboard. The game will also have an interaction key which would be 'E', allowing the user to interact with the map when trying to find and then beat the puzzles. These controls will be used for both users as it is an online game, however there can be a local game mode for both players where the arrow keys would be used for the other player, just like[ Fireboy and Watergirl](1.3-research-the-problem.md#features-i-will-include-1).

### Two Player

The game will have two players playing together in a split screen scenario like that of [Bloons TD Battles 2](1.3-research-the-problem.md#overview), and will similarly allow them to interact with each other. The players should aim to prevent their opponents from beating their game, while simultaneously being able to try and beat their game first.

## Limitations

### Limitation 1

Description of a limitation, due to scope/time constraints or difficulty of implementation.
