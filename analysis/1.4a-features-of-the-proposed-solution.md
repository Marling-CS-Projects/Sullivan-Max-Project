# 1.4a Features of Proposed Solution

## Broad Category 1

### Movement

The characters will move at a constant speed without acceleration. This will give the user more control as their character will use at the same speed at all times, and mean that they can focus on puzzles rather than worrying about managing the speed of their character.

### Controls

The game will use the WASD controls to allow the characters to move, which is very common for games utilising a keyboard. The game will also have an interaction key which would be 'E', allowing the user to interact with the map when trying to find and then beat the puzzles. These controls will be used for both users as it is an online game and so different keys do not need to be used as if it was a game done locally such as Fireboy and Watergirl.

## Limitations

### Limitation 1

Description of a limitation, due to scope/time constraints or difficulty of implementation.
