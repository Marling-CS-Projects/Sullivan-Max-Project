# 1.4a Features of Proposed Solution

## Mechanics

### Movement

The characters will move at a constant speed without acceleration. This will give the user more control as their character will use at the same speed at all times, and mean that they can focus on puzzles rather than worrying about managing the speed of their character.

### Controls

The game will use the WASD controls to allow the characters to move, which is very common for games utilising a keyboard, and the spacebar will be used for jumping. The game will also have an interaction key which would be 'E', allowing the user to interact with the map when trying to find and then beat the puzzles. These controls will be used for both users as it is an online game, but there will not be a local game mode such as in [Fireboy and Watergirl](1.3-research-the-problem.md#fireboy-and-watergirl).

### Two Player

The game will have two players playing together in a split screen scenario like that of [Bloons TD Battles 2](1.3-research-the-problem.md#overview), and will similarly allow them to interact with each other. The players should aim to prevent their opponents from beating their game, while simultaneously being able to try and beat their game first. The game being two player is too encourage competition between them, as they try and race each other to beating the puzzles and making their way through the map.

### Collisions&#x20;

In the game there will be the possibility for the character to hit in to objects or walls, causing collisions. Therefore it is important the interactions work as planed, as when in the map the character should remain where they are, but in certain minigames there may be different desired interactions. Therefore it is important that they work as intended and that the character cannot go through the walls or any other unintended bugs.

## Layout and design

### Camera View

The perspective of the player will be a side scrolling camera featuring platforms, similar to [Fireboy and Watergirl](1.3-research-the-problem.md#fireboy-and-watergirl). The player will have to explore the map to find puzzles to beat and then to eventually make their way out of the map. The camera will follow the character as they move along the map, keeping the character near the centre of the screen as they move along, but will also mean that the will be unable to see much of the map further around them.

### Puzzles and Minigames

The game will focus on the puzzles, that will are able to be found at random points throughout the map and will change with each play through. The puzzles that are found will also be in a random order, as to allow for players to replay the game.

The way these various minigames, similar to that of [Just Act Natural](1.3-research-the-problem.md#just-act-natural), work will be one player aiming to beat the games, while the other player in the split screen is able to watch and to interact with them while playing their own game, being able to try and stop them from completing the challenge. These minigames will not be in the map, being in a new environment, however there will be puzzles that are not minigames on the map that require solving that cannot be changed by your opponent.

### Obstacles and objects

In the game the player will need to interact with obstacles and objects in the game, with the interaction key highlighted in [controls](1.4a-features-of-the-proposed-solution.md#controls). Interaction with these objects could be from activating minigames to moving obstacles to find a way out of part of a map. None of these obstacles will aim to harm the player, only slow them down as they try to figure out how they can get past them. This concept of obstacles and objects is especially highlighted in [Fireboy and Watergirl](1.3-research-the-problem.md#fireboy-and-watergirl), where this is a common puzzle presented to players.

## User interface and Design

### User Interface

Players should have a useable menu to navigate when logging in to the game, that should allow them to perform actions such as create and join lobbies and change settings. The menu is meant to be functional and does not need to much graphics wise.

When creating or joining a private lobby, players will have to select to either join or create in the menu, and then will be directed to a new screen where they can enter what is necessary. For creating a lobby, this would be the custom name, and once that is submitted they will be taken to a lobby screen showing the players and a code will be shown to them. For joining a lobby, they will have a place to enter a code, and will be taken to the same lobby screen, from which the leader can start the game.

### Split Screen

As the game is split screen, being two players playing against each other, the user and their game will only occur on their side of the screen. One important aspect of this is making sure that the user knows which side of the screen they are, and they should be shown before the game starts. Although they are only playing on one side of the screen, they will still need to monitor both sides, as they try and hamper their opponent's progress. The ability to see your opponent's game means that the two players will have unique maps, but the order and gameplay of minigame is random so that doesn't need to changed. But is also important that these maps are balanced, so one player wont have an advantage over another.

### Design

I wish for my world design to be quite a simple design, with a pixel art style synonymous with a retro game design. The advantage of a pixel art style is that it can be quite effective at allowing players to differentiate different objects in the map, making it easier for the players and meaning they wont get hung up on unnecessary obstacles. Pixel art can also be easier to create, which would allow for me to have more time for other aspects.



### Save

In my game there will be a save system allowing players to save their progress . Their progress will not be in the game itself, as they are online and so it can't be, however there can be a level system, allowing users to monitor their progress, and they can see how much they have played, and other stats about their time on the game. To save their progress, users will have to make an account when they first begin playing the game, and this will also give them their own username.

## Limitations

### Minigames

Although there will be numerous minigames, it would always be better if there were more so users wouldn't think the game was so repetitive, however there is a limit to the amount i can add as I will need to focus on other aspects of the game.

### Maps

I would want to add multiple maps for users, so they can have a unique experience every time they play, however given the time I have, it may be a bit too complicated and easier to focus on the one map being successful.

### Platform Support

My game will be designed only for users on PC, and so not for those on a console. Although I would like to have all platforms able to play my game, producing a fun and functional game is more of a priority than allowing for more users to be able to play.

### Performance

As my game is a browser game, it's performance will be limited to the capabilities of the browser it is being run on.
