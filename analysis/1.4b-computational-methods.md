## Thinking Abstractly and Visualisation

Thinking abstractly is a core part of programming and is about being able to focus on the key parts of the program and removing the unnecessary elements to complete the main task. Abstraction is about separating the logical and physical aspects of a problem and using a model to represent the problem. The use of thinking abstractly is that it helps programmers to problem solve as they identify problems and their patterns.

An aspect of thinking abstractly would come into the visuals in my game. I can spend less time and have less detail in the visuals of my game, and spend more time on aspects more integral to my game. This could include the background and using a simpler art style as to focus on the parts of my project that are necessary for it to work rather than just look good.&#x20;

## Thinking Ahead

Thinking ahead is an important part of programming, as it allows you to think about and plan what is required for your program. After using abstraction to identify the integral aspects of the program, the use of thinking ahead then allows for the programmer to ensure an efficient outcome, and to plan about using aspects such as caching and pre-fetching. By thinking ahead, you can allow for future adjustments after planning out and documenting that plan, to allow for the project to meet its requirements. If changes need to be made, having a plan that is flexible allows for adaptions, so adjustments can be made and there will not need to be a complete overhaul of the project.&#x20;

## Thinking Procedurally and Decomposition

Decomposition is about breaking down a problem into several smaller problems that all work together to solve the original problem. This allows programmers to have the task split into several small sub-sections that are a lot smaller and easier to complete, and plan the overall method of solution. It is important to think procedurally and to order and divide these subroutines logically, so these numerous parts can all come together to form the original program.

I can use thinking procedurally and decomposition in my own project to break down all aspects of my solution and think about what aspects of the solution and in what order need to be done. This concept of logical sequencing in my project should allow me to cover all aspects of my project in the subroutines.

## Thinking Logically

Thinking logically is about aiming to maintain a good and logical code that is clear, precise, and efficient. To maintain this, efforts should be made by the programmer to plan where errors may occur in thinking logically, such as hierarchy charts, flowcharts, and pseudocode. Conditional statements that involve decisions are perhaps the most common cause of logic errors, and therefore testing different inputs is crucial and so trace table scan help prevent these logical errors.

Within my game, I should make sure that the various imports from the user correspond to the correct output. Examples of this include:

* When a player interacts with an object, the correct response should happen, whether it be a mini game, text or nothing.
* When an action occurs, there should be the correct and corresponding sound should play.

## Thinking Concurrently

Thinking concurrently is about having multiple processes running simultaneously, by having an overall task being broken down into smaller tasks for the processors to complete. Considering my game has two screens running simultaneously, thinking concurrently is a crucial element, and if used correctly I can have a faster experience.
