## Thinking Abstractly and Visualisation

Thinking abstractly is a core part of programming and is about being able to focus on the key parts of the program and removing the unnecessary elements to complete the main task. Abstraction is about separating the logical and physical aspects of a problem and using a model to represent the problem.

## Thinking Procedurally and Decomposition

Decomposition is about breaking down a problem into several smaller problems that all work together to solve the one original problem. This allows programmers to have the task split into several small sub-sections that are a lot smaller and easier to complete. It is important to think procedurally and to try and divide these subroutines logically, so these numerous parts can all come together to form the original program.
