### Overview

In this game, you control one side of the screen in an online tower defense game and have to place and then upgrade different types of monkeys to defend against oncoming "bloons". The aim is to not let the bloons go all the way round various different maps, as that would mean you lose life. Some of these bloons come automatically for each player at the start of each round, however some can come from your opponent on the other side of the screen when they pay for them. In return for sending more bloons at your opponent, you can try and get your opponent to lose life, but you can also increase the amount of money you make each cycle. The winner is then the person who doesn't lose all of their life, or if the game goes all 40 rounds, the player with the most life.

### Controls

The game uses the mouse for most of the game, such as to move monkeys to the position where they can be located to send in bloons and to buy upgrades. However there are shortcuts.                &#x20;
