<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/LameFlashyBoubou-max-1mb.gif" alt=""><figcaption><p>Gameplay from Bloons TD Battles 2</p></figcaption></figure>

### Overview

In this game, you control one side of the screen in an online tower defense game and have to place and then upgrade different types of monkeys to defend against oncoming "bloons". The aim is to not let the bloons go all the way round various different maps, as that would mean you lose life. Some of these bloons come automatically for each player at the start of each round, however some can come from your opponent from the other side of the screen when they pay for them. In return for sending more bloons at your opponent, you can try and get your opponent to lose life, but you can also increase the amount of money you make each cycle. The winner is then the person who doesn't lose all of their life, or if the game goes all 40 rounds, the player with the most life. The game is rated PEGI 3.

### Controls

The game uses the mouse for most of the game, such as to move monkeys to the position where they can be located to send in bloons and to buy upgrades. However there are shortcuts for the keyboard that can make managing the game easier. The game does not have controller support, which my game also won't have. The game requires the user to use the left mouse button to move and place monkeys, and also to send bloons at the opponent.  &#x20;

| Multiplayer                    | My game focuses on having two players, and so would have to be multiplayer.                                                                         |
| Controls                       | Use simple controls that use the keyboard and doesnt have controller support.                                                                       |
| Easily accessible interface    | The interface should be clear for users so that they know what different abilities do. These can either be outlined through images or through text. |
| Interaction with your opponent | The game focuses on interactivity between opponents, so they need to be able to influence each other's gameplay.                                    |

| Lives system            | The game wouldn't have a lives system as it is puzzles without a time limit or any restrictions on them.                                                         |
| Different Characters    | My game will not utilize different characters, as there will only be one character.                                                                              |
| Tower Defense           | The game wouldn't be a tower defense game, it would be a puzzle game and so the tower defense element isn't a good fit. This includes the bloons not being used. |
| Multiple different maps | My game will have puzzles occur once, and so there is no need for multiple different maps.                                                                       |
| Money                   | My game doesn't need to have currency or have a way for them to gain money, and so it won't be included.                                                         |

| Controls       | The game uses the keyboard WASD or arrow key control, and as my game is intended for use on a computer, this is what I should use.                            |
| Multiplayer    | My game also requires there being more than one player at a time, and so I will include the multiplayer element.                                              |

| Cooperative  | My game focuses on two players playing individually and against each other, and so cooperative would go against what my game is.  |
| Gems         | My game is focused on completing puzzles and racing an opponent, and so adding a extra element such as gems wouldn't be needed.   |
| Platformer   | My game is a puzzle game, and so the game will not be a platformer.                                                               |
