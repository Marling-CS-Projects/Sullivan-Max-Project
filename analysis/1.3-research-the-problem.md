### Overview

In this game, you control one side of the screen in an online tower defense game and have to place different types of monkeys to defend against oncoming "bloons". The aim is to not let the bloons go all the way round various different maps, as that would mean you lose life. Some of these bloons come automatically from each player, however some can come from your opponent on the other side of the screen, when they pay for them. In return, you can try and get your opponent to lose life, but you can also gain the amount of money you make each cycle.
