### Overview

In this game, you control one side of the screen in an online tower defense game and have to place and then upgrade different types of monkeys to defend against oncoming "bloons". The aim is to not let the bloons go all the way round various different maps, as that would mean you lose life. Some of these bloons come automatically for each player at the start of each round, however some can come from your opponent on the other side of the screen when they pay for them. In return for sending more bloons at your opponent, you can try and get your opponent to lose life, but you can also increase the amount of money you make each cycle. The winner is then the person who doesn't lose all of their life, or if the game goes all 40 rounds, the player with the most life.

### Controls

The game uses the mouse for most of the game, such as to move monkeys to the position where they can be located to send in bloons and to buy upgrades. However there are shortcuts for the keyboard that can make managing the game easier. The game does not have controller support, which is all my game would have.            &#x20;

| Multiplayer/Interaction with your opponent | My game focuses on having two players, and so would have to be multiplayer. The game also focuses on interactivity between opponents, and so would be necessary.  |

| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Lives system  | The game wouldn't have a lives system as it is puzzles without a time limit, and so it wouldn't be necessary. |
| Tower Defense | The game wouldn't be a tower defense game, it would be a puzzle game and so the tower defense element         |
