# 1.1 Problem Identification

Video games and puzzle games in particular are proven to have a positive impact on the cognitive ability of the player. Video games are known to improve abilities such as visual-spatial recognition, working memory and information processing speed and according to a study by (Pallavincini, Ferrari and Mantovani, 2018), puzzle games can also  improve both the cognitive and emotional abilities of adults, therefore showing the positive impact of puzzle games.

There is also a benefit in games being multiplayer, as discussed by (O’Connor, 2022), as the social aspect of these multiplayer games can be a positive for some players. The multiplayer market is also one that has been growing, as shown by (Charity, 2023), and therefore is a desirable market to be in. However in spite of this, some players do prefer single player games, as explored by (Severin, 2022) and so my game will also feature single players aspects, since players play by themselves.

The video game market is one that has been growing, and will only continue to in the coming years, being worth £7.16 billion in 2021 (Osborn, 2022) and had spending on software of £4.28 billion.&#x20;
