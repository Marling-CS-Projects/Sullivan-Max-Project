# 4.2 Evaluation of Usability Features

## Effective

| Feature No. | Description                                           | Success/Fail |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| 1           | Create a goal to reach to determine the end of a game | Success      |
| 2           | Create a clear goal for multiplayer                   | Fail         |
| 3           | Create a clear goal for puzzles and minigames         | Success      |
| 4           | Create fair gameplay for all users                    | Success      |

### Feature 1

There is a goal, as developed in [Cycle 7](../design-and-development/2.2.7-cycle-7-adding-the-final-level.md#outcome), which results in the end of the game. From my testing, some people believe that the goal may not be as clear, however the majority do agree given the nature of the game, and recogniz=se that there will be something eventually to signify the end that will be reached after playing through the game.

### Feature 2

This is a fail as multiplayer was a feature that was not added into my game, and therefore adding a clear goal for multiplayer isn't possible. With the addition of multiplayer, which could be possible with more time, this would involve allowing players to comprehend why multiplayer was added and what they are able to do, which shouldn't bee too hard to integrate.&#x20;

### Feature 3

There is a clear goal for puzzles and minigames that is shown to players. For puzzles, aspects of the puzzle are added as they complete different parts of the puzzle, allowing them to see there next goal, creating that clear goal. For minigames, there is text that shows they have to dodge the objects, which they can then frequently see. I believe this shows that the objectives are clear, and my testing from [3.2](../testing/3.2-usability-testing.md#effective) shows the players do generally agree.

### Feature 4

This feature while it may have originally somewhat related to the multiplayer aspect of the game, is definitely still relevant. The gameplay for my game should be balanced with regards to the difficulty and also have the gameplay environment be one that should allow the players to play and beat the game. I ensured to develop my game with this all in mind, as it is a very important aspect of user enjoyment.

## Efficient

| Feature No. | Description                                                                                      | Success/Fail |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------ |
| 1           | Create a menu system that is quick and easy to navigate through                                  | Success      |
| 2           | Create a controls system that isn't too complicated but allows the player to do multiple actions | Success      |

### Feature 1

This was a success as the menu meets these requirements of being quick and easy to use. My testing has shown that many users agree with this assessment. The menu was designed so that only one screen is necessary, and all aspects are incorporated as quickly and efficiently as possible to meet this feature as much as possible.

### Feature 2

The game needs to be easy to understand and to play, therefore showcasing the importance of having simple controls. Using the most basic and expected controls of WASD for my game helps, alongside clearly detailing any other controls the player may need to use makes this feature a success.

## Engaging

| Feature No. | Description                                        | Success/Fail |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| 1           | Create a multiplayer mode to play                  | Fail         |
| 2           | Create puzzles and minigames to play               | Success      |
| 3           | Incorporate a style of game art the suits the game | Fail         |

### Feature 1

This feature is a fail since despite originally being a very key aspect of the game, it proved an aspect that proved too time-consuming and difficult to add. This caused a big change in the criteria and direction of my game, and so ultimately I have not met this criteria at all.

### Feature 2

These levels are a major aspect of the gameplay, making up the majority of the time the user is playing. I aimed to have enough levels so that the gameplay wouldn't begin to feel repetitive after multiple times playing the game, and 6 levels that are either puzzles or minigames are done in a changing order, and do somewhat allow for this.

### Feature 3

Designing more intricate objects of the game with a suitable art style is something that would have taken a lot of effort and time and would not add to the actual gameplay. This was only met when it was necessary, so with the characters since they need a distinct design, but I failed to use it for everything in the game.

## Error Tolerant

| Feature No. | Description                                                        | Success/Fail |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------ |
| 1           | The game doesn't crash                                             | Success      |
| 2           | The game does not contain any bugs that damage the user experience | Fail         |

### Feature 1

The game doesn't crash and that makes this a success. After testing the game and aiming to stress the system to try and crash the game, although there was one issue regarding being able to infinitely use a lever that would break the game, nothing else has been found and that has been fixed.

### Feature 2

Trying to ensure the game is without bugs has proved very challenging for this game. The aim is to not have any bugs, however, due to not meeting this, I have classed this as a fail. During my testing, several bugs were found, which then allowed me to fix these. However unfortunately there was one that wasn't able to be fixed.&#x20;

There have been some bugs that had been identified and haven't been able to be fixed. For example, players are still able to interact with levers while not directly touching them, and this is an issue that has been present throughout the development. These issues do not majorly impact gameplay, as players begin to acknowledge this bug is present and thus can play around it, but the experience would be better if it didn't happen at all.

## Easy To Learn

| Feature No. | Description                                                 | Success/Fail |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| 1           | The game should not be too hard for all players to complete | Success      |
| 2           | Create ways of helping the user to beat certain levels      | Success      |

### Feature 1

An important aspect of this game is aiming to be challenging for the players, but it also wants to be achievable and allow for players to understand what they will need to do, especially given the game is pegi 3 and so the age of players could be very small. The way in which puzzle elements of the game are designed means that the next objective is typically added after the first is done, therefore showing the player what they may need to do next.

### Feature 2

Given the game wants to be challenging, it could be possible, especially given the potential age of players for them to get stuck. This is an outcome that wants to be avoided, so adding text to give some sort of a clue and to move the player in the right direction. Text, the way in which this is achieved, is only sometimes added, only for levels from which my testing and observing players had proved particularly difficult.
