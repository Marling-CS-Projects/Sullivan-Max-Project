# 4.1 Evaluation of Success Criteria

## Mechanics

### Criteria

| Criterion | Description                 | When was it achieved |
| --------- | --------------------------- | -------------------- |
| 1         | Movement animation          | Not developed.       |
| 2         | Movement Controls           | Cycle 3              |
| 3         | Side-Scrolling Camera       | Cycle 3              |
| 4         | In Game Physics             | Cycle 3              |
| 5         | Object Interaction Controls | Cycle 3              |
| 6         | Gameplay Interaction        | Cycle 9              |

### Criterion 1 - Not achieved

Movement animation would have referred to having some sort of design for the character moving to try and make it a smoother experience. I have decided to not implement any sort of movement animation as it would take too much time to implement and ultimately not contribute much to the gameplay. With more time this could be a feature that was implemented.

### Criterion 2&#x20;

This is about allowing the player to move, which is obviously a very crucial aspect of my game. The game needs to have basic controls that allows the player to do as they please, including moving and jumping.

### Criterion 3

The camera is a mechanic that allows the player to follow their character as it moves, which is necessary so they can play the game. The use of the side scrolling camera fits my game perfectly as a platformer.

### Criterion 4

In the game there needs to be correct physics aspects. This is crucial as it needs to follow the rules of physics, and also means that the player is unable to do something that would be unexpected.&#x20;

### Criterion 5

This is with regards to the more complex controls, originally interacting with objects, but later also became relevant to the character of the Grungler. This allows the player to do what they want with regards to the objects, which is relevant to trying to solve the puzzles and make it past the levels, and also then for the ability of the Grungler.

### Criterion 6

This has changed since the original requirements drawn up, however it does still meet the same requirements. The point of the interaction is that is aims at hindering the player, so that it is harder for them and ultimately slows them down.

## User interface

### Criteria

| Criterion | Description                  | When was it achieved |
| --------- | ---------------------------- | -------------------- |
| 7         | Menu Interface               | Cycle 10             |
| 8         | Lobbies                      | Not developed.       |
| 9         | Creating an account          | Not developed.       |
| 10        | Saving Progress              | Not developed.       |
| 11        | The UI should be easy to use | Cycle 10             |

### Criterion 7

Having a menu screen that is easy to understand seemed crucial given it is the first thing that the user will see. From this menu, players are able to do whatever they may want to do, whether it be going to a new scene or changing a variable such as the character.

### Criterion 8 - Not achieved

This would only need to be a feature if multiplayer was added, and since it wasn't this doesn't need to be added, and would only be added if multiplayer was included.

### Criterion 9 - Not achieved

This is a feature that would be added if the database of my project was connected to my game. Due to time constraints that has not been completed and so neither has the criterion.

### Criterion 10 - Not achieved

Due to criterion 9 not being completed, this also cannot be completed, however with more time this would be something that could be implemented.

### Criterion 11

This relates to ensuring that the menu meets the user requirements, mainly being efficient. As shown by my testing in [3.2](../testing/3.2-usability-testing.md#efficient), my users agree that I have met this criterion. By aiming to keep concise and onto only one screen, it is simple and easy to use.

### Other Criterion

When the criterion was created, the game that was planned was different than the current one. Due to this, it only felt right to include other criteria that would have been in this section that weren't included due to the original idea.

### Timer

The timer is only started upon entering the first level, and is stopped once they complete the game. The time is only seen by the user once they have completed the game.

## Levels and Layout

### Criterion

| Ref. No. | Description           | When was it achieved                   |
| -------- | --------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| 12       | Split Screen          | Not developed.                         |
| 13       | Two Separate Worlds   | Not developed.                         |
| 14       | Puzzles               | Cycle 4, Cycle 4.b, Cycle 5, Cycle 5.b |
| 15       | Minigames             | Cycle 6, Cycle 6.b                     |
| 16       | Equal Chance          | Not developed.                         |
| 17       | Obstacles and objects | Cycle 3 to Cycle 7                     |

### Criterion 12 - Not achieved

Given that the multiplayer aspect of my game was not implemented, with more time this feature could be added. However, due to the time constraints, this has not been added.

### Criterion 13 - Not achieved

This is something that only needed to be added if multiplayer was. However, due to it not being added, this criterion for improving gameplay is not needed.

### Criterion 14

This is a very central theme to my game and so needed to be done well. The puzzle levels need to be a mixture of challenging but also able to be understood and be able to be completed in a good amount of time. From my testing, I believe the results show this has been achieved, given people did agree they found the levels puzzling, however the overall game not too hard.

### Criterion 15

The minigames is another vital aspect of the game, given their prevalence in the game. Similar to the puzzle aspects, they need to be balanced, not being too hard or taking too long, but also not being too easy, so they are an impactful aspect of gameplay

### Criterion 16 - Not achieved

This also is only relevant for a multiplayer game, and so hasn't been developed.

### Criterion 17

Obstacles and objects are such an integral aspect of my game, as they are often the way puzzles function. Obstacles allow the user to see what the goal of their current puzzle is, and objects often allow them to reach this goal. Through the information from [3.2](../testing/3.2-usability-testing.md#engaging), it is shown that the puzzles meet the requirements, and therefore so do the objects and obstacles, however the source of a lot of bugs that occur in the game seems to come from this, and while I have fixed all that I am aware of, it doesn't mean that there may not be any more, and most likely related to these.

## Non-functional features

### Criterion

| Ref. No. | Criterion                                         |                                                                                       |
| -------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 18       | PEGI Rating                                       | [3.2](../testing/3.2-usability-testing.md#criterion-18)                               |
| 19       | The game should be able to run                    | [3.1](../testing/3.1-robustness.md#criterion-19-the-game-should-run-without-crashing) |
| 20       | The game should be able to with a good frame rate | [3.1](../testing/3.1-robustness.md#criterion-20-the-game-should-run-at-a-good-fps)    |
| 21       | Setting                                           | Not developed.                                                                        |
| 22       | The game should be enjoyable                      | [3.2](../testing/3.2-usability-testing.md#criterion-22)                               |
| 23       | Music                                             | [3.2](../testing/3.2-usability-testing.md#criterion-23)                               |

### Criterion 18

This has been evidenced in [3.2](../testing/3.2-usability-testing.md#criterion-18), and is important for real-world development and building the game for the correct audience, as shown in [1.2](../analysis/1.2-stakeholders.md#demographics), however, my testing shows players agree with the pegi rating.

### Criterion 19

This has already been evidenced in [3.1](../testing/3.1-robustness.md#criterion-19-the-game-should-run-without-crashing), and from that and the testing in [3.2](../testing/3.2-usability-testing.md#error-tolerant) it is shown that the game crashing is not much of an issue for this game anymore, and can run well consistently.

### Criterion 20

This has also been evidenced in [3.1](../testing/3.1-robustness.md#criterion-20-the-game-should-run-at-a-good-fps), and using the information from testing in[ 3.2](../testing/3.2-usability-testing.md#error-tolerant), having a good framerate and lag is not something that is affecting gameplay much anymore. Of course, in some instances it can, however, these are not issues due to my game.

### Criterion 21 - Not achieved

This non-functional feature was not added due to time constraints that required me to focus on more important aspects of gameplay instead of this. With more time however, this would be an easy feature to add.

### Criterion 22

### Criterion 23
