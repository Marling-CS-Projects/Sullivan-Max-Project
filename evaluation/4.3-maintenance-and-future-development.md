# 4.3 Maintenance and Future Development

## Current Limitations of Project

* **Length of gameplay ->** Currently, there are only 8 scenes of gameplay, which results in gameplay being a few minutes. Ideally, there would be more scenes to allow for longer but also more varied gameplay which would improve the overall gameplay experience.
* **Performance ->** The game runs on a browser and therefore requires an internet connection to be played, which can limit when people can play the game.
* **Accessibility ->** The game is only run from a browser and therefore can only be played on PC or laptop. While it is accessible to most if not all browsers, the game could be expanded to having support for controller support.
* **Productivity ->** Aiming to fix any issues that may occur from players after playing the game would be tough to fix, especially since it is just one person working on the game and not a team of people.
* **Graphics ->** There are no real graphics currently implemented into the game, and even if graphics were to be implemented, they would still be quite basic art style.
