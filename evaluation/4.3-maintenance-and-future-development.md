# 4.3 Maintenance and Future Development

## Current Limitations of Project

* **Length of gameplay ->** Currently, there are only 8 scenes of gameplay, which results in gameplay being a few minutes. Ideally, there would be more scenes to allow for longer but also more varied gameplay which would improve the overall gameplay experience.
* **Performance ->** The game runs on a browser and therefore requires an internet connection to be played, which can limit when people can play the game.
* **Accessibility ->** The game is only run from a browser and therefore can only be played on PC or laptop. While it is accessible to most if not all browsers, the game could be expanded to having support for controller support.
* **Productivity ->** Aiming to fix any issues that may occur from players after playing the game would be tough to fix, especially since it is just one person working on the game and not a team of people.
* **Graphics ->** There are no real graphics currently implemented into the game, and even if graphics were to be implemented, they would still be quite basic art style.

## Maintenance

Keeping maintenance for my game would require aiming to ensure the game remains without bugs and also expanding the game. The size of these developments could vary depending on the size and capabilities of the plans for the game, however, they would all aim to improve or add to the game. It would be sensible to aim to keep the same language and structure as the rest of the game.

**Short-term maintenance:**&#x20;

Aspects of short-term maintenance need to focus on any errors immediately found in the game, for example, found in my testing. It would focus less on adding features to the game and more on fixing errors that have been previously found, and ensuring the game continues to function as expected.

Smaller features such as a good looking UI and art styles are aspects that could be implemented quickly. Along with this, addressing any issues that came up in my testing would be important for maintainability and allowing me to meet the elements where users felt could be improved such as the aims of the game or the minigames, or aiming to reduce lag present in the game.

**Long-term maintenance:**&#x20;

The aspects of long-term maintenance relevant to my game are adding levels to the game to aim to improve the overall experience. There is also adding more characters to the game as well, as another way to include more variance in gameplay.
